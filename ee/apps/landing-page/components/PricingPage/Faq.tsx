            A chat is counted whenever a user starts a discussion. It is
            independant of the number of messages he sends and receives. For
            example if a user starts a discussion and sends 10 messages to the
            bot, it will count as 1 chat. If the user chats again later and its
            session is remembered, it will not be counted as a new chat. <br />
            <br />
            An easy way to think about it: 1 chat equals to a row in your
            Results table

            That&apos;s amazing, your bots are working full speed. ðŸš€
            <br />
            <br />
            You will first receive a heads up email when you reach 80% of your
            included limit. Once you have reached 100%, you will receive another
            email notification.
            <br />
            <br />
            After that, your chat limit be automatically upgraded to the next
            tier.

            Can I cancel or change my subscription any time?

          <Text>
            Yes, you can cancel, upgrade or downgrade your subscription at any
            time. There is no minimum time commitment or lock-in.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you upgrade or downgrade your subscription, you&apos;ll get
            access to the new options right away. Your next invoice will have a
            prorated amount.

            Do you offer annual payments?

          <Text>
            No, because subscriptions pricing is based on chats usage, we can
            only offer monthly plans.
