## Getting started

### Importance of Training Chatbots on Personalized Data

Personalized data ensures that your chatbot delivers highly relevant and accurate responses. This enhances user satisfaction. By tailoring the chatbot to your specific content, like Typebot’s documentation, users get precise information. This makes interactions smoother and more productive.

### Overview of the Tutorial

In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to train your chatbot using Typebot and OpenAI. We will use Typebot’s documentation to build a question-answering bot. The process is actionable and easy to follow. You’ll see exactly how to set up your environment, create the assistant, and integrate everything without writing a single line of code.

### Benefits of Using Typebot and OpenAI for Training

Typebot provides an intuitive, no-code platform that simplifies the creation of advanced conversational apps. Pairing Typebot with OpenAI’s powerful AI models allows you to harness natural language understanding and generation. This combination delivers a robust chatbot capable of providing detailed and context-aware responses.

## Curating Your Knowledge: Preparing Your Data

The quality of your chatbot's responses directly ties to the data you feed it during training. Before training your chatbot, gather the documents or data you want it to use. For our example, we’ll use the Typebot documentation to create a question-answering chatbot for Typebot users.

### Types of Data to Collect

When training your chatbot, diverse and comprehensive data is better. Consider gathering the following types of information:

- Product documentation and manuals
- Sales and marketing materials
- Industry-specific terms and jargon
- Internal knowledge bases and training materials
- FAQs
- Support articles
- Tutorials

By providing your chatbot with a rich variety of data, you'll equip it to handle a wide range of queries and scenarios.

### Sources for Gathering Data

Data can come from various channels within your organization. Potential sources include:

- Existing databases and content management systems
- Customer support ticketing systems
- Sales and marketing collateral repositories
- Subject matter experts and domain authorities within your company

Collaborate with cross-functional teams to capture the most relevant and up-to-date information from across your organization.

### Structuring Data for Chatbot Training

Ensure your data is well-organized. Divide it into clear sections and topics so the chatbot can easily reference it.

Remove irrelevant information and correct any errors. Preprocessed data helps the assistant generate more accurate responses.

## Step 1: Create your Typebot

### Introduction to Typebot

Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder that empowers you to create advanced conversational apps visually. No coding skills? No problem. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, you can add text bubbles, inputs, conditional logic, webhooks, and even integrate third-party services like Google Sheets and OpenAI.

### Setting Up Your Typebot Account

Begin by setting up your Typebot account. Visit [Typebot.io](https://typebot.io/) and click on the "Sign Up" button. Fill in the required details, verify your email, and you’re in.

Your dashboard is the control center where all the magic happens.

### Creating Your First Bot in Typebot

       height={1110}
     />

## Step 3: Design your chatbot

### Adding a Text Input Element

Start by adding a text input element to your Typebot. This is essential as it will collect the user's initial message. Here’s how to do it:

1. Go to your bot’s editor in Typebot.
2. Click on “Add Element” and choose “Texts” from the Input options.
3. Save the user’s answer in a variable.

     width={684}
     height={452}
   />

### Inserting an OpenAI Block

To bring your bot to life with AI responses, you’ll integrate an OpenAI block.

1. **Add OpenAI Block:**
   - Drag the "OpenAI" block from the left panel and drop it into your "AI Loop" group.

       width={592}
       height={800}
     />
2. **Choose Your OpenAI Account:**
   - Click on the OpenAI block to open its settings.
   - Select your OpenAI account from the dropdown menu. Create one if necessary.

       src="/images/blog/train-chatbot-on-own-data/typebot-add-openai-key.jpg"
       width={700}
       height={235}
     />
3. **Select 'Ask Assistant':**
   - Choose the "Ask Assistant" option to configure the assistant that will respond to user inputs.
     <Image

       src="/images/blog/train-chatbot-on-own-data/typebot-ask-assistant.jpg"
       width={655}
       height={350}
     />
   - Select your newly created assistant from the Assistant ID dropdown.
4. **Establish the Thread:**
   - Create a variable named `threadID` to manage conversation continuity.
5. **Save Assistant's Response:**
   - Collect the assistant’s reply and store it in a new variable, such as `assistant last message`. The Assistant should look like this:
     <Image
       alt="Typebot Assistant Parameters"
       src="/images/blog/train-chatbot-on-own-data/typebot-assistant-parameters.jpg"
       width={800}
       height={917}
     />
6. **Show Response to User:**
   - Use a text bubble to display the `assistant last message` on your Typebot interface.
7. **Link the Blocks:**
   - Connect the "Text Input" block to the "OpenAI" block to ensure user messages are sent to the AI for processing. And then, connect the last message to the first input. As soon as the assistant has answered, the user will be allowed to send a message back.

The final result should look like this:

<Image

  src="/images/blog/train-chatbot-on-own-data/typebot-assistant-configured.jpg"
  width={1060}
  height={914}
/>

These steps integrate OpenAI’s capabilities into your Typebot, ensuring that your chatbot can intelligently respond to user queries based on the configured assistant.

## Step 4: Testing and Iterating Your Chatbot

### Testing the AI Loop

Before deploying your chatbot, thorough testing is essential to ensure it functions as desired.

1. **Run Initial Tests:**
   - Enter your Typebot dashboard and initiate your bot.
   - Send a simple message, like "Hi there," to see how the chatbot responds.
2. **Observe Responses:**
   - Ensure the assistant's response is correctly displayed.
   - Check if the conversation loops back to prompt for another user message.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with a smooth setup, you might encounter hiccups. Here’s how to tackle them:

1. **Response Delay:**
   - If responses are slow, check your OpenAI integration settings.
   - Ensure your API key and connection are properly configured.
2. **Incorrect Outputs:**
   - Verify the assistant's training data.
   - Make sure the correct documents and instructions are uploaded in the OpenAI Playground.
3. **Message Handling Issues:**
   - Check if the `userLastMessage` and `assistantLastMessage` variables are correctly capturing and displaying messages.
   - Ensure the `threadID` variable is correctly managing the thread context.

### Iterating for Improved Interactions

Continuous improvement is vital for maintaining a top-notch chatbot.

1. **User Feedback:**
   - Collect feedback from users interacting with your bot.
   - Identify areas where the assistant might be falling short or causing confusion.
2. **Refining Instructions:**
   - Update the assistant's instructions in the OpenAI Playground to make responses more accurate.
   - Add more context-specific documentation if needed.
3. **Regular Testing:**
   - Routinely run tests after making adjustments.
   - Ensure improvements lead to better interactions and user satisfaction.

By systematically testing, troubleshooting, and iterating your chatbot, you’ll ensure it delivers exceptional user experiences continuously, keeping your Typebot AI-driven and user-focused.

## Using Templates for Quick Setup
