Head over to the `Settings` tab of your typebot, under the `General` section you can find the `Remember user` setting.

This setting allows you to save the chat session state into the user's web browser storage. It means that if he answers a question and then closes the chat, the next time he opens it, the chat will be in the same state as it was before.

There are 2 storage options:

- **Local storage**: The chat state will be saved in the user's web browser. It will be available only on the same device and web browser.
- **Session storage**: The chat state will be saved in the user's web browser. It will be available only on the same device and web browser, but it will be deleted when the user closes the current tab or the web browser.

Note that if you publish a new version of your typebot, saved sessions will be automatically resetted. It means that if the user has a saved session, if he refreshes the bot and that a new version is published, the bot will restart from the beginning.
