title: How to get help?
---

Here is what you should do if you have an issue or even a question (this list is ordered from fastest to slowest resolution time):

1. Read this documentation. I do my best to keep it up to date and to cover all the possible issues and questions. Use the search bar to find what you are looking for.
2. You can ask for help or report your bug in the [Discord community](https://typebot.io/discord). Specifically in the `#help-and-questions` channel. I try to answer all the questions there daily. There is also a good chance that someone else has already asked the same question and you can find the answer there using the search bar.
3. Users subscribed to the `Starter` or `Pro` plan can directly reach out to me through the chat widget in the bottom right corner of the app.

<Note>
  I'm working on a AI-powered typebot that will be able to answer most of the
  questions. It's not ready yet but it's coming soon.

## If this is urgent

An urgent request is something that is causing a major issue for you or your business in relation to Typebot in production.

If that is the case, report it [here](https://typebot.co/urgent-support).
