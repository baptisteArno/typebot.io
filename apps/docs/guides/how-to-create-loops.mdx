title: How to create loops?

In this video, I demonstrate how to implement a dynamic loop to collect guest names for a restaurant reservation chatbot.

I walk through setting up the chatbot to request the number of guests, and then, using JavaScript, create a list based on this number.

I explain how to use the 'Shift' set variable value to iterate through this list, collecting and storing each guest's name.

Despite the lack of a specific loop block in the platform, I show how to create a loop-like behavior through custom code.
