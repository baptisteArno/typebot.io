# FAQ

## Why some of my results are empty?

Your typebot collects results as soon as your user answers the first input. If other inputs have a blank answer, it means the user never answered them and left the bot.

## How can I delete a block or an edge?

You can right-click on most elements in the graph to open up a contextual menu.

## Is human takeover is available on Typebot?

Live chat is not natively integrated. Typebot is specifically built for async chats. You can still have a human takeover feature using the [Chatwoot block](/editor/blocks/integrations/chatwoot). It will open a Chatwoot live chat box whenever the block is hit.

You can also implement great customer support with Typebot by using a ticketing system such as [Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) or [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/). You can create a ticket each time your user answers the bot.

## Is there an affiliate program available?

I'm not planning on having a Typebot affiliation program.

As a customer, I don't like when someone promotes a tool with an affiliation because we could think that the only reason he's promoting it is that he can win big comparing with other tools.

Natural recommendations resonate a lot more with me. My goal is to create the best user experience possible, so I really hope you will recommend Typebot for free. 🤝

## How can I change my password

Typebot doesn't store any password. Its login works with Github, Google, Facebook and Magic link email.
