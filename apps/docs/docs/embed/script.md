# Script embed snippet

The script embed option is useful only if you don't have access to the HTML tree of your application or if your website builder only allows you to inline script snippets.

Otherwise, it's preferable to follow [HTML & Javascript](./html-javascript) embed instructions because the script snippets are just scripts that will inject the code from the HTML & Javascript embed method.
