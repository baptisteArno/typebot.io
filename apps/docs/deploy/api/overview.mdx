Your bot can also be executed with HTTP requests. This is useful if you want to integrate your bot with another service or if you want to use it in a different programming language.

## Test

1. All your requests need to be authenticated with an API token. [See instructions](/api-reference/authentication).
2. To start the chat, send a POST request to `https://typebot.io/api/v1/typebots/<typebot ID>/preview/startChat` The first response will contain a sessionId that you will need for subsequent requests.
3. To send replies, send POST requests to `https://typebot.io/api/v1/sessions/<session ID>/continueChat`
   With the following JSON body:

   ```json
   {
     "message": "This is my reply"
   }
   ```
