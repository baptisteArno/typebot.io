To get the appropriate instructions to deploy your Bot in your platform of choice, make sure to head over the `Share` tab of your bot and select the platform you want to deploy your Bot on.

You can choose to embed your Bot in 3 different ways.

## Standard

Embeds the Bot in a box with the size of your choice anywhere on your app. This is what is used on Bot homepage:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/embeddings/standard.png" alt="Standard" />
</Frame>

You can also set the width to `100%` and the height to `100vh` to make it take the entire page dimensions

## Popup

Embeds the Bot in a Popup that overlays your website. It can be triggered after a delay or with a click of a button for example

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/embeddings/popup.png" alt="Popup" />
</Frame>

## Bubble

Embeds the Bot as a "chat bubble" at the bottom right corner of your site. Can be triggered automatically or with a click. It can also come with a "proactive message".

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/embeddings/bubble1.png" alt="Bubble 1" width="600px" />
</Frame>
