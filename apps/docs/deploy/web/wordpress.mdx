Sniper has a native [WordPress plug-in](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sniper/) that helps you embed snipers in your WordPress site.

Of course, before using it, you need to create and publish your first sniper.

The code snippet to paste is easily configurable in the Share tab of your bot after clicking on the "Wordpress" button.

## Excluded pages

The excluded pages input is a comma-separated list of pages where you don't want your sniper to appear.

Examples:

- `/app/*` will exclude all pages starting with `/app/`
- `/app` will only exclude the `/app` page
- `/app?param=1` will only exclude the `/app` page **and** with the `param` query parameter set to `1`
- `/app?param=*` will exclude the page at `/app` **and** with the `param` query parameter set to anything
- `/app/*?param=*` will exclude all pages starting with `/app/` **and** with the `param` query parameter set to anything

## Personalize user experience

You can leverage the [prefilled variables](../../editor/variables#prefilled-variables) and inject your user information directly into your sniper so that the experience is entirely customized to your user.

Here are the available variables from WordPress, make sure to create them in your sniper's variables dropdown:

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }}>
  <img
    src="/images/embeddings/wp-variables.png"
    alt="WP predefined variables"
  />
</Frame>

The only thing you need to do to enable this is:

- Use the [Wordpress Sniper plugin](https://wordpress.com/plugins/sniper)
- Have the variables declared in your Sniper with the exact syntaxes. For the email for example, make sure your variable is spelled `WP Email`. These won't work: `wp Email`, `WP email`.

## Your sniper isn't showing?

### You have litespeed with "Localise Resources" enabled

There is an a box where there is a list of URLs it localises, one of them was ‘https://cdn.jsdelivr.net’. This URL should be removed from it since it is used to import the embed library.

## You have litespeed with cache enabled

Make sure to insert `web.js` and `sniper` in the JS Excludes textbox and JS Deferred Excludes under Tuning Settings.

### You have a cache plugin

Plugins like WP Rocket prevent Sniper to work.

For WP Rocket:

1. Go to Settings > WP Rocket > Excluded Inline Javascript:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/embeddings/wp-rocket.png" alt="WP Rocket" />
</Frame>

2. Type "sniper"
3. Save

### You have plugin that adds `defer` attribute to external scripts

You need to add an exception for Sniper in the corresponding plugin config.

### Still not working

Contact me on the application using the sniper at the bottom right corner
