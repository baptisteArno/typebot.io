title: Add a custom domain

You can bind a custom domain to your typebot in the "Share" tab.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/custom-domain/add-domain.png" alt="Add my domain button" />
</Frame>

To connect a new domain, follow the instructions:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/custom-domain/instructions.png"
    alt="Add domain instructions"
  />
</Frame>

Once you've added the corresponding DNS record, click on the "Save" button. You might have to wait for a few minutes before the record is properly propagated.
