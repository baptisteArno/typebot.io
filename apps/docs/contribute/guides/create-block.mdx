Creating a new block on Typebot is pretty easy and straightforward using our in-house framework [The Forge](../the-forge/overview).

<Note>
  If you are considering merging this new block to the official Typebot
  repository, make sure to open a [Github
  issue](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/issues/new) first. This will
  allow us to discuss the specficiation and the best way to implement it.
</Note>

1. [Install the project locally](./local-installation)
2. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

3. Create your new block using the [Forge CLI](../the-forge/overview#forge-cli):

   ```sh
   pnpm run create-new-block
   ```

4. The files should be generated in `packages/forge/blocks/YOUR_BLOCK_NAME`
5. Add the block SVG logo in `packages/forge/blocks/YOUR_BLOCK_NAME/logo.tsx`
6. Right away you should be able to [run the application](./local-installation#running-the-project-locally) and see your newly created logo in the sidebar of the editor.
7. Create a new action in the `packages/forge/blocks/YOUR_BLOCK_NAME/actions` folder. See [Action](../the-forge/action) for more information.
8. List this action in the `actions` array in `packages/forge/blocks/YOUR_BLOCK_NAME/index.tsx`
9. To go further, check out the [Forge documentation](../the-forge/overview).

Make sure to check out other blocks implementations in the [packages/forge/blocks](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/tree/main/packages/forge/blocks) folder.
