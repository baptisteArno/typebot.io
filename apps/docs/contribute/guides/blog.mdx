## New article guidelines

- The article should be related to chatbots, or Typebot.
- The article should be written in English.
- The article should be original content. No plagiarism.
- The article should not be 100% AI-generated.

The mdx file should always start with the following frontmatter:

```md
---
title: 'My awesome blog post'
publishedAt: '2023-11-19'
summary: 'A short summary of the blog post.'
---
```

By default the og image is generated from the title of the blog post. If you want to use a custom og image, you can specify a `image` field in the frontmatter.

All images need to be placed under the `public/images/blog/<POST_FILENAME>` folder where `<POST_FILENAME>` is the name of the mdx file you are creating/editing. The image file name should be in lowercase and separated by `-`. It is best if the image width is no more than 800px.

All links to other blog posts should look like `/blog/<POST_SLUG>`.

Here are all the components you can use in your blog post:

- `Image`: To display an image. `width` and `height` props are required and must match the actual size of the image. Example: `<Image src="/images/blog/my-awesome-blog-post/image.jpg" alt="My awesome image" width={800} height={600} />`
- `Callout`: To display a callout. Example: `<Callout status="info" title="Takeaway">This is an info callout</Callout>`. You can provide a `status` prop with the value `info`, `warning`, `success`, or `error`. You can also pass an optional `title` prop.
- `Tweet`: To embed a tweet. Example: `<Tweet id="1234567890123456789" />`
- `Typebot`: To embed a typebot as a Standard component. Example: `<Typebot typebot="<YOUR_BOT_PUBLIC_ID>" />`. You can provide the same props as the [Standard component](../../deploy/web/libraries/react#standard).
- `YouTube`: To embed a YouTube video. Example: `<YouTube id="<YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID>" />`
- `Loom`: To embed a Loom video. Example: `<Loom id="<LOOM_VIDEO_ID>" />`
- `Cta`: To display a call-to-action that redirects to Typebot. Example: `<Cta />`
- `Table`: To display a table. It expects 2 props: `headers` and `rows`. Example:

  ```tsx
  <Table
    headers={['Feature', 'Typebot', 'Landbot']}
    rows={[
      [
        'Pricing',
        'Free plan, $39/mo Starter, $99/mo Pro',
        'Free plan, €40/mo Starter, €150/mo Pro, €400/mo Business',
      ],
      [
        'Integrations',
        'Google Sheets, Webhooks, Zapier, Make, SendGrid',
        'Dialogflow, Salesforce, Slack, Google Sheets, Zapier, Mailchimp',
      ],
      [
        'Customization',
        'Full theme customization, custom CSS',
        'Limited theme options',
      ],
    ]}
  />
  ```
