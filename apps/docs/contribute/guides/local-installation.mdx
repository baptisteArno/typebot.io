## Get started

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

## Running the project locally

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   cd typebot.io
   pnpm i
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Copy `.env.dev.example` to `.env`

   Check out the [Configuration guide](https://docs.typebot.io/self-hosting/configuration) if you want to enable more options

3. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) running

4. Make sure you have Node.js installed. I suggest you use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) allowing you to manage different versions. Once you installed nvm, you can install and use the latest version of Node.js: `nvm install && nvm use`

5. Start the builder and viewer

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Builder is available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

   Viewer is available at [`http://localhost:3001`](http://localhost:3001)

   Database inspector is available at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555)

   By default, you can easily authenticate in the builder using the "Github Sign In" button. For other options, check out the [Configuration guide](https://docs.typebot.io/self-hosting/configuration)

6. (Optional) Start the landing page

   Copy `apps/landing-page/.env.local.example` to `apps/landing-page/.env.local`

   ```sh
   cd apps/landing-page
   pnpm dev
   ```

7. (Optional) Start the docs

   ```sh
   cd apps/docs
   pnpm start
   ```
