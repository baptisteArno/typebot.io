## Get started

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

## Running the project locally

1. Make sure you have node, [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. For node, I suggest you use [`proto`](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) or [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) allowing you to manage different versions. It should then autodetect which version need to be installed before running any command.

2. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   cd typebot.io
   bun install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables

   Copy `.env.dev.example` to `.env`

   Check out the [Configuration guide](https://docs.typebot.io/self-hosting/configuration) if you want to enable more options

4. If you use the default DATABASE_URL, you need a matching database running. You can do that easily with the provided `docker-compose.dev.yml` file:

   ```sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -d up
   ```

5. Start the builder and viewer

   ```sh
   bunx turbo dev --filter=builder... --filter=viewer...
   ```

   Builder is available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

   Viewer is available at [`http://localhost:3001`](http://localhost:3001)

   By default, you can easily authenticate in the builder using the "Github Sign In" button. For other options, check out the [Configuration guide](https://docs.typebot.io/self-hosting/configuration)

6. Optionnally you can also run the other available apps:

    ```sh
    bunx turbo dev --filter=builder... --filter=viewer... --filter=@typebot.io/prisma... --filter=landing-page... --filter=docs...
    ```
