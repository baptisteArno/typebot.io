Typebot is fair source and can be self-hosted on your own server. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own instance of Typebot.

<Note>
  The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed
  service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). You'll have high availability,
  backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste,
  Typebot's founder.
  <br />
  The cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and
  resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value option and the
  revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development of Typebot. So
  you'll be supporting fair source software and getting a great service!

| Hosting | Easy and convenient. It takes 1 minute to start building your bots and share them with a worldwide high availability, backups, security and maintenance all done for you by me, [Baptiste, Typebot's founder](https://twitter.com/baptisteArno). I manage everything so you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything and can focus on creating great bot experiences. | You do it all yourself. You need to get a server and you need to manage your infrastructure. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup, security, stability, consistency, loading time and so on. |
| Storage | All visitor data is exclusively processed on EU-owned cloud infrastructure. This ensures that your bots data processing complies with GDPR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | You have full control and can host your instance on any server in any country that you wish. Host it on a server in your basement or host it with any cloud provider wherever you want.                                                              |
| Costs   | I charge a subscription fee. Whether you're a solo business owner, a growing startup or a large company, Typebot is here to help you build high-performing chat forms for the right price. Pay for as little or as much usage as you need.                                                                                                                      | You need to pay for your server, your database, your S3 storage, backups and whatever other cost there is associated with running the infrastructure. You never have to pay any fees to us.                                                          |

## License requirements

Typebot is available under the Functional Source License (FSL).

You can find the full license [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/main/LICENSE).

This license allows you to do anything with Typebot except undermine its producer. You can run it for almost all purposes, study it, modify it, and distribute your changes, including proposing improvements back to the producer. After two years it becomes permissive Open Source software under Apache 2.0.

## Releases

The self-hosted version is somewhat of a LTS, you only get new release once a month. If you want features as soon as they are available, consider becoming a [cloud user](https://app.typebot.io). New versions are published on the [releases page](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/releases).

## Ready to self-host?

Typebot is composed of 2 Next.js applications you need to deploy:

- the builder, where you build your typebots
- the viewer, where your user answer the typebot

I've written guides on how to deploy Typebot using:

- [Docker](/self-hosting/deploy/docker)
- [Vercel](/self-hosting/deploy/vercel)
- [Manual](/self-hosting/deploy/manual)
