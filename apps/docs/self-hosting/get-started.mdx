Typebot is open-source and can be self-hosted on your own server. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own instance of Typebot.

<Note>
  The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed
  service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). You'll have high availability,
  backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste,
  Typebot's founder.
  <br />
  The cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and
  resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value option and the
  revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development of Typebot. So
  you'll be supporting open source software and getting a great service!

| Hosting | Easy and convenient. It takes 1 minute to start building your bots and share them with a worldwide high availability, backups, security and maintenance all done for you by me, [Baptiste, Typebot's founder](https://twitter.com/baptisteArno). I manage everything so you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything and can focus on creating great bot experiences. | You do it all yourself. You need to get a server and you need to manage your infrastructure. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup, security, stability, consistency, loading time and so on. |
| Storage | All visitor data is exclusively processed on EU-owned cloud infrastructure. This ensures that your bots data processing complies with GDPR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | You have full control and can host your instance on any server in any country that you wish. Host it on a server in your basement or host it with any cloud provider wherever you want.                                                              |
| Costs   | I charge a subscription fee. Whether you're a solo business owner, a growing startup or a large company, Typebot is here to help you build high-performing chat forms for the right price. Pay for as little or as much usage as you need.                                                                                                                      | You need to pay for your server, your database, your S3 storage, backups and whatever other cost there is associated with running the infrastructure. You never have to pay any fees to us.                                                          |

## License requirements

You can find the full license [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/main/LICENSE).

Here is a summary of the license:

All content that resides under the [ee](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/tree/main/ee) directory of this repository is licensed under the license defined in [ee/LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/main/ee/LICENSE). The [ee](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/tree/main/ee) folder contains the code for the [landing page](https://typebot.io) and the billing feature. We restrict these to a Commercial License to make sure other companies can't simply clone Typebot's homepage and billing system and offer the same service without contributing to the open-source project.

Content outside of this directory is available under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3). The goal of the AGPLv3 license is to:

- Maximize user freedom and to encourage companies to contribute to open source.
- Prevent corporations from offering Typebot as a service without contributing back to the open source project
- Prevent corporations from confusing people and making them think that the service they sell is in any shape or form approved by the original team

Here are the 3 different possible use cases:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="You'd like to self-host Typebot as-is without modifying the source code and you don't have the intention to commercialize your version of Typebot.">
  You can host and use Typebot without restrictions. Your contributions to
  improve Typebot and fix bugs are welcome. üíô
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You'd like to fork the project to build your own features on top of Typebot and you don't have the intention to commercialize your version of Typebot.">
  You need to open-source your modifications
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You'd like to commercialize your own version of Typebot">
  <ol>
    <li>You need to open-source your fork of the project.</li>
    <li>
      After your users registration, you should provide a prominent mention and
      link to the original project (https://typebot.io). You should clearly
      mention that you provide a modified version of the official project,
      Typebot. It would be also a good place to explain your version advantages
      comparing to the original project.
    </li>
    <li>If you want to use code that resides under the [ee](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/tree/main/ee) folder (landing page or billing feature), you need a [Commercial License key](https://typebot.io/enterprise-lead-form).</li>
    <li>You need to provide a link to your forked repository somewhere in the landing page or the builder. This way, interested users can easily access and review the modifications you've made.</li>
  </ol>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Either use case, [sponsoring the
  project](https://github.com/sponsors/baptisteArno) is a great way to give back
  to the community and to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the
  project. It also comes with some perks like priority support and private
  workshops. ‚ù§Ô∏è
</Note>

## Releases

The self-hosted version is somewhat of a LTS, you only get new release once a month. If you want features as soon as they are available, consider becoming a [cloud user](https://app.typebot.io). New versions are published on the [releases page](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/releases).

## Ready to self-host?

Typebot is composed of 2 Next.js applications you need to deploy:

- the builder, where you build your typebots
- the viewer, where your user answer the typebot

I've written guides on how to deploy Typebot using:

- [Docker](/self-hosting/deploy/docker)
- [Vercel](/self-hosting/deploy/vercel)
- [Manual](/self-hosting/deploy/manual)
