Typebot is fair source and can be self-hosted on your own server. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own instance of Typebot.

<Note>
  The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed
  service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). You'll have high availability,
  backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste,
  Typebot's founder.
  <br />
  The cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and
  resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value option and the
  revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development of Typebot. So
  you'll be supporting fair source software and getting a great service!

I manage everything so you don’t have to worry about anything and can focus on creating great bot experiences. | You do it all yourself. You need to get a server and you need to manage your infrastructure. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup, security, stability, consistency, loading time and so on. |

Host it on a server in your basement or host it with any cloud provider wherever you want.                                                              |

## License requirements

Typebot is available under the Functional Source License (FSL).

You can find the full license [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/main/LICENSE).

This license allows you to do anything with Typebot except undermine its producer. You can run it for almost all purposes, study it, modify it, and distribute your changes, including proposing improvements back to the producer. After two years it becomes permissive Open Source software under Apache 2.0.

<Note>
  [Sponsoring the
  project](https://github.com/sponsors/baptisteArno) is a great way to give back
  to the community and to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the
  project. It also comes with some perks like priority support and private
  workshops. ❤️

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What does the license allow me to do?">
    You can do anything with Typebot except undermine its producer. Here is a non-exhaustive list of things you can do with a self-hosted instance:

    ✅ As a company, create and publish your bot into your client-facing products

    ✅ As a freelancer, create bots for your clients

    ✅ Create (commercial) education / content about Typebot

    ✅ Do (commercial) research

    Here is a non-exhaustive list of things you cannot do:

    ❌ Commercialize the access to your instance

    ❌ Offer services for hosting Typebot instances

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I integrate the Typebot editor in my existing software?">
    ❌ **You legally cannot do this**. If you are selling your software, integrating the Typebot editor would mean competing against Typebot Cloud, which violates the project's license. However, you can use the code from two years ago, which is available under the Apache 2.0 license.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I commericalize my own Typebot instance?">
    ❌ **You legally cannot do this**. This would mean you are competing against Typebot Cloud, which violates the project's license. However, you can use the code from two years ago, which is available under the Apache 2.0 license.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can you be sustainable if you’re giving your software for free?">
    Typebot is fair source not because it is good business even though I tink it creates instant trusts with prospects since the code is 100% public, it can be audited.

    I personnally love when a software is open source. I get the chance to contribute to the code if I ever find a bug or need a new feature. When I benchmark 2 similar softwares, I almost always choose the one that is open source for that reason.

    Everything I do with Typebot is to make it like a software I would personally love using.

    Since I run Typebot as a solo entrepreneur, I also feel like making Typebot fair source is more sustainable as I can get the help from the community.

## Releases

The self-hosted version is somewhat of a LTS, you only get new release once a month. If you want features as soon as they are available, consider becoming a [cloud user](https://app.typebot.io). New versions are published on the [releases page](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/releases).

## Ready to self-host?

Typebot is composed of 2 Next.js applications you need to deploy:

- the builder, where you build your typebots
- the viewer, where your user answer the typebot

I've written guides on how to deploy Typebot using:

- [Docker](./deploy/docker)
- [Vercel](./deploy/vercel)
- [Manual](./deploy/manual)
