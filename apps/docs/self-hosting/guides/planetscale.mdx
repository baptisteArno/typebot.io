title: Using a PlanetScale database
---

Typebot is also pluggable to a PlanetScale database. But it means, you'll need to push schema changes manually.

To do so, follow these instructions:

1. Replace `DATABASE_URL` with a PlanetScale development branch URL.
2. From the `packages/prisma` directory, run a the db push command: `bun db:push`
3. Then, in PlanetScale dashboard, or using their CLI, you can create a new deploy request from this development branch to your production branch.

<Note>
  You can't connect to PlanetScale database if you are deploying with Docker as
  docker images are currently built only with postgresql support.
