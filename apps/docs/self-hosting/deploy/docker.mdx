<Info>
  The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed
  service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). You'll have high availability,
  backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste,
  Typebot's founder. The cloud version can save a substantial amount of
  developer time and resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value
  option and the revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development
  of Typebot. So you'll be supporting fair source software and getting a great
  service!

## Requirements

You need a server with Docker installed. If your server doesn't come with Docker pre-installed, you can follow [their docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) to install it.

## Installation

### 1. Download the compose file

On your server, download the latest `docker-compose.yml` and the starter `.env` file:

```sh
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/latest/docker-compose.yml
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/latest/.env.example -O .env
```

### 2. Add the required configuration

1. You'll first need a random 32-character secret key which will be used to encrypt sensitive data. Here is a simple way to generate one:

   ```sh
   openssl rand -base64 24 | tr -d '\n' ; echo
   ```

2. Fill the `.env` file with your values.
3. Configure at least one authentication provider (Email, Google, GitHub, Facebook or GitLab). More info here: [Configuration](../configuration).

By default the compose file will pull the latest stable Typebot images: `baptistearno/typebot-builder:latest` and `baptistearno/typebot-viewer:latest`. You can decide to replace `latest` with a specific version. You can find all the existing tags [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/baptistearno/typebot-builder/tags)

### 3. Start the server

Once you've added your configuration to the compose file, you're ready to start up the server:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

When you run this command, by default, it does the following:

- Create a database
- Run the migrations
- Start the builder on port 8080
- Start the viewer on port 8081
- All Typebot's data is stored in the `.typebot` folder in the current directory

You can now navigate to `http://typebot.domain.com:8080` and see the login screen. Login with the admin email to have access to a Team plan workspace automatically.

Typebot server itself does not perform SSL termination. It only runs on unencrypted HTTP. If you want to run on HTTPS you also need to set up a reverse proxy in front of the server. See below instructions.

### Update Typebot

Typebot is updated regularly, but it is up to you to apply these updates on your server. By virtue of using Docker, these updates are safe and easy to apply.

1. Pull the new images:

   ```sh
   docker-compose pull typebot-builder
   docker-compose pull typebot-viewer
   ```

   Alternatively, you can pull specific versions:

   ```sh
    docker-compose pull typebot-builder:1.0.0
    docker-compose pull typebot-viewer:1.0.0
   ```

2. Stop the server:

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

3. Start the server (with the new images):

   ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
   ```

The self-hosted version is somewhat of a LTS, only getting the changes (~ once per month) after they have been battle tested on the cloud version. If you want features as soon as they are available, consider becoming a [cloud user](https://app.typebot.io).

## Optional extras

### Reverse proxy

By default, Typebot runs on unencrypted HTTP on ports 8080 for the builder and 8081 for the viewer. We recommend running it on HTTPS behind a reverse proxy of some sort. You may or may not already be running a reverse proxy on your host, let's look at both options:

#### No existing reverse proxy

If your DNS is managed by a service that offers a proxy option with automatic SSL management, feel free to use that. For example, you could use Cloudflare as a reverse proxy in front of Typebot.

Alternatively, you can run your Caddy server as a reverse proxy. This way your SSL certificate will be stored on the host machine and managed by Let's Encrypt. The Caddy server will expose port 443, terminate SSL traffic and proxy the requests to your Typebot server.

Here is an example of a docker-compose file using Caddy as a reverse proxy:

```yml
version: '3.3'
services:
  caddy-gen:
    container_name: caddy-gen
    image: 'wemakeservices/caddy-gen:latest'
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro
      - {$PWD}/.typebot/caddy-certificates:/data/caddy
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    depends_on:
      - typebot-builder
      - typebot-viewer

  typebot-builder:
    labels:
      virtual.host: 'typebot.domain.com' # change to your domain name
      virtual.port: '3000'
      virtual.tls-email: 'admin@example.com' # change to your email

  typebot-viewer:
    labels:
      virtual.host: 'bot.domain.com' # change to your domain name
      virtual.port: '3000'
      virtual.tls-email: 'admin@example.com' # change to your email
      # Necessary to enable message streaming
      virtual.proxy.directives: |
        flush_interval -1
```

This config requires you to add the following DNS entry:

```
typebot IN A <server_ip>
bot IN A <server_ip>
```

You can merge this compose file with the first one. Make sure that `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to `https://typebot.domain.com` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIEWER_URL` is set to `https://bot.domain.com`.

When running the compose file, it should automatically enable SSL on your server and you should be able to navigate to:

- `https://typebot.domain.com` for the builder
- `https://bot.domain.com` for the viewer

#### Existing reverse proxy

If you're already running a reverse proxy, the most important things to note are:

1. Configure the virtual hosts to match the `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIEWER_URL` in your `docker-compose` configuration.
2. Proxy the traffic to `127.0.0.1:8080` or `{ip-address}:8080` and to `127.0.0.1:8081` or `{ip-address}:8081` if running on a remote machine

### SMTP

I highly recommend using an external SMTP service. There are tons of options out there, including [SendInBlue](https://www.sendinblue.com/), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). It will avoid severe headaches 😅. Then, you will only need to add the required [SMTP configuration variables](/self-hosting/configuration#email-auth-notifications).

If, however, you don't want to, you can instantiate an SMTP server in the docker-compose file.

```yml
version: '3.3'
services:
  mail:
    image: bytemark/smtp
    restart: always
```

And add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```
SMTP_HOST=mail
NEXT_PUBLIC_SMTP_FROM=notifications@typebot.domain.com
```

You will probably need to make sure that `typebot.domain.com` has a valid SPF record and that your server IP has a rDNS set up.

You can merge this compose file with the main one.

### S3 storage

If you don't already have an S3 storage available, you could include it in your docker-compose file:

```yml
version: '3.3'

volumes:
  s3-data:

services:
  minio:
    image: minio/minio
    command: server /data
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
    environment:
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: minio
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: minio123
    volumes:
      - s3-data:/data
  # This service just makes sure a bucket with the right policies is created
  createbuckets:
    image: minio/mc
    depends_on:
      - minio
    entrypoint: >
      /bin/sh -c "
      sleep 10;
      /usr/bin/mc config host add minio http://minio:9000 minio minio123;
      /usr/bin/mc mb minio/typebot;
      /usr/bin/mc anonymous set public minio/typebot/public;
      exit 0;
      "
```

And add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```
S3_ACCESS_KEY=minio
S3_SECRET_KEY=minio123
S3_BUCKET=typebot
S3_ENDPOINT=storage.domain.com
```

This config requires you to add the following DNS entry:

```
storage IN A <server_ip>
```

You can merge this compose file with the main one.
