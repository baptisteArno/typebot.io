<Note>
  The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed
  service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). You'll have high availability,
  backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste,
  Typebot's founder. The cloud version can save a substantial amount of
  developer time and resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value
  option and the revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development
  of Typebot. So you'll be supporting fair source software and getting a great
  service!
</Note>

## Requirements

You need a PostgresDB database hosted somewhere. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) offer great free options.

## Getting Started

Fork the repository

## Disable Github workflows

You may want to [disable the Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow) as they are most likely not relevant to your use of Typebot. This can be done.

## Reduce function maxDuration (Hobby plan only)

If you deploy on a Vercel Hobby plan, you will need to reduce the `maxDuration` timeout options in `apps/viewer/vercel.json` and set it to `10`

<Note>

- Builder is the application where you'll create your flows.
- Viewer is the bot interface your users will interact with.

</Note>

### Deploy the builder

1. Create a new Vercel project and import the forked repo
2. Change the project name to: `typebot-builder` (or anything else)
3. Choose Next.js framework
4. Change the root directory to: `apps/builder`
5. Change the build command to:

   ```sh
   bunx turbo build --filter=builder... && bunx turbo db:migrate
   ```

6. Add the required environment variables ([Check out the configuration guide](/self-hosting/configuration))
7. Hit "Deploy"

### Deploy the viewer

1. Create a new Vercel project and import the forked repo
2. Change the project name to: `typebot-viewer` (or anything else)
3. Choose Next.js framework
4. Change the root directory to: `apps/viewer`
5. Change the build command to:

   ```sh
   bunx turbo build --filter=viewer... && bunx turbo db:migrate
   ```
