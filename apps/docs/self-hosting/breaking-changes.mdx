title: Breaking changes
---

This lists all the breaking changes introduced in each version of Typebot.

Make sure to check all the intermediate versions as well. For example, if you are on **v2.21** and would like to upgrade to **v2.29**, you should apply all the breaking changes from **v2.21** to **v2.29**.

## v3.0

### Google variables renamed

`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY` have been removed in favor of:

- Auth: `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Sheets: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY`
- Fonts: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY`

It allows for more granular control over the Google APIs you are using. Instead of enabling all of them.

If you still want to use the same keys for all Google APIs, you just have to set the same value for all of them.

### New license

The license was changed from AGPLv3 to FSL. It means that you can't fork the project to commercialize a Typebot competitor anymore. See the new requirements [here](./get-started).

### Migrated from pnpm to bun

Typebot is now using bun instead of pnpm as a package manager. Which means practically all deployments instructions need to be updated to now use bun.
