title: Breaking changes
---

This lists all the breaking changes introduced in each version of Typebot.

Make sure to check all the intermediate versions as well. For example, if you are on **v2.21** and would like to upgrade to **v2.29**, you should apply all the breaking changes from **v2.21** to **v2.29**.


## v3.6

Existing chat sessions will crash if you come from v3.4 or below as we deleted a deprecated prop in session state. Make sure to first upgrade to v3.5, let all the ongoing chat sessions end and then upgrade to v3.6.

## v3.5

`workspaceId` optionnality was removed from chatSession state schema. If you have active chat sessions, make sure to first upgrade to v3.4 and wait for a few days for the incremental migration is done.

## v3.0

### Google variables renamed

`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY` have been removed in favor of:

- Auth: `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Sheets: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY`
- Fonts: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY`

It allows for more granular control over the Google APIs you are using. Instead of enabling all of them.

If you still want to use the same keys for all Google APIs, you just have to set the same value for all of them.

### New license

The license was changed from AGPLv3 to FSL. It means that you can't fork the project to commercialize a Typebot competitor anymore. See the new requirements [here](./get-started).

### Migrated from pnpm to bun

Typebot is now using bun instead of pnpm as a package manager. Which means practically all deployments instructions need to be updated to now use bun.
