## Change language

You can change the language of the application by going to your `Settings & Members` menu under the `Preferences` tab.

<Info>
  The application is still being translated, so some parts may not be translated
  yet. This is tracked in [this
  issue](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/issues/955).
