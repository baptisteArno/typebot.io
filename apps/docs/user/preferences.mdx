## Generate groups title with AI

You can automatically have your group titles generated with AI by going to your `Settings & Members` menu under the `Preferences` tab.

Here you'll have to configure your AI provider.

<Info>
If you don't see your provider credentials listed that's because you don't have it in your personal user credentials. [See distinction between worksapce and user credentials.](./credentials)
</Info>

Once enabled and properly configured, you'll see default group titles (starting with "Group #") changing whenever you connect a new group/block from this group.
