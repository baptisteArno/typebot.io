The Return block is used to bring the conversation back to where it left off before a temporary jump happened.

Whenever you "jump" to another part of your flow (using a Jump block or an Event trigger), the conversation temporarily moves away from the main path.
By placing a Return block, you tell Typebot:

> "Okay, I'm done here — now go back to where the user was."

## When should you use a Return block?

You should use a Return block whenever you want the conversation to resume its previous flow after a jump.

✅ After using a [Jump block](./jump).

✅ Inside an Event-triggered subflow.

## When is a Return block NOT needed?

Some blocks automatically return to where they were without needing a Return block.

You do NOT need a Return block when using the [Link to Typebot block](./typebot-link). It automatically returns when the linked flow finishes.

## Example use cases

- You use a Jump block to temporarily ask the user a few clarification questions, then you place a Return block to resume the original conversation.
