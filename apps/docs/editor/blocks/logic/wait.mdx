title: Wait

The "Wait" block allows you to pause the conversation for a certain amount of seconds.

This can be useful if you want the bot to emphasize on what's been said or to wait before a redirection for example to make sure the user has read everything.

<Warning>
  This should be used wisely. If you want the bot to write slower or faster in a
  more general sense, you need to check the [Typing emulation
  settings](/settings/overview#typing-emulation)
</Warning>

## Pause the flow

You can enable the "Pause the flow" option if you ever need to mark a pause in the flow.

Under the hood, typebot always compute all the blocks between each input blocks. But sometimes you may want to display some messages before a long-running action.
