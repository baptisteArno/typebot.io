With the Posthog block, you can send events to Posthog and trigger your Posthog workflows. It uses the Posthog Node.js library to send server side events to Posthog, so that it works on non web browser devices.

## How to find my `Project API Key` and `API Host`?

To find your `Project API Key`, you need to go to your Posthog Settings page and click on the `General` link. Then scroll down to the Web Snippet and copy the api key and host info from the snippet;

## Get Flag

This action allows you to get a flag from Posthog. It requires the `Flag Name` and `User ID`. You can choose between `Boolean` and `Multivariate` flags. If the flag is enabled for the user, the action will retrieve the flag payload and store it in the `Flag Payload` variable that you configure.
