## Zendesk Messaging

With the Zendesk Chat block, you can open a Zendesk Messaging live chat window to allow a user to chat with a Zendesk agent.

## How to find my Zendesk `Key ID` and `Secret Key`?

To configure your Web Widget or mobile SDK for visitor authentication, you first need a signing key. A signing key is a type of credential which is comprised of a key id (kid) and a shared secret.

You can view, create, and delete signing keys by clicking the Account icon in the Admin Center sidebar, and then selecting End user authentication under the Security heading ( you will need to be a Zendesk Admin). The shared secret will only be displayed in its entirety when the signing key is first created.

## Open Web Widget

This action opens the Messenging Web Widget. It requires the Web Widget `Key` to be set. You can find the key by going to `Channels -> Messaging`, then click on the Web Widget you wish to configure. Scroll down to 'Installation' and expand that section. In the script code block, copy the `key` value and use that for the `Key` setting.

Note, this only works on web clients.

If the `User ID` option is set, a JWT token will be created and passed to Zendesk, to authenticate the user in Zendesk. If you need `Name` or `Email` included in the JWT token, set those options also.
