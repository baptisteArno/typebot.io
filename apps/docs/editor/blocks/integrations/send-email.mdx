title: Send email
---

If you want to receive an email notification each time a user completes the bot or if you want to send a recap to the user, the Email block is made for you:

<Frame style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }}>
  <img src="/images/blocks/integrations/email.png" alt="Email block example" />
</Frame>

By default, the email will be sent from `notifications@get-sniper.com` with default content based on what your new lead has replied to. It will look like this:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/blocks/integrations/default-email.png"
    alt="Email block example"
  />
</Frame>

You can choose to use your email (SMTP) account, using the "From:" dropdown and filling in your credentials.
You can also customize the email content with your text/HTML.

## Attachments

You can attach files to your email with the Attachments option. Make sure that it points to a variable that is linked to a File upload input block.

## Troubleshooting

You are supposed to receive an email but it doesn't get to your inbox? Make sure to check the [logs](/results/overview#logs). If you still can't figure out what went wrong, shoot me a message using the chat button directly in the tool üëç
