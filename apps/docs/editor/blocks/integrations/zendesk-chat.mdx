With the Zendesk Chat block, you can open a Zendesk Messeneger live chat window to allow a user to chat with a Zendesk agent. Note, this only works on web clients.

## How to find my Zendesk `Key ID` and `Secret Key`?

To configure your Web Widget or mobile SDK for visitor authentication, you first need a signing key. A signing key is a type of credential which is comprised of a key id (kid) and a shared secret.

You can view, create, and delete signing keys by clicking the Account icon in the Admin Center sidebar, and then selecting End user authentication under the Security heading ( you will need to be a Zendesk Admin). The shared secret will only be displayed in its entirety when the signing key is first created.

## Authenticate User

This action will generate a JWT token that can be passed as a variable to Open Messeneger you to authenticate a user in Zendesk. It requires the `User ID`, `Name` `Email`. Optionally, you can also set `Email Is Verified` if the email address has been verified. This is recommended to be set if appropriate.

## Open Messenger

This action opens the Messenger window. It requires the Zendesk `Key` to be set. If `Enable User Authentication` is enabled, and a token is set in the `User Auth Token` field, the user will be authenticated in Zendesk.
