This block allows you to integrate your Dify.AI's assistant in your typebot.

## Create Chat Message

This action sends a user message to your agent. Then you can save `Answer` to a variable and display it in your typebot.

You are expected to provide the following parameters:

- `Query`: The user message you want to send to your agent.
- `Conversation ID`: The conversation ID you want to use for this message. If you don't provide one, a new conversation will be created. This variable content will be updated automatically if a new conversation is created.
- `User`: The user email used to identify the user in the conversation.
