The Gmail integration allows you to send emails directly through your Gmail account using Google's Gmail API. This provides a more reliable and feature-rich email sending experience compared to generic SMTP.

## Authentication

The Gmail integration requires OAuth2 authentication to access your Gmail account.

You can connect with Typebot default OAuth app or use your own credentials.

## Configuration Options

### Basic Settings

- **To**: The recipient's email address
- **Subject**: The email subject line
- **Body**: The email content (supports plain text and HTML)
- **Attachments**: Include file attachments (variable containing file URLs)

### Advanced Settings

- **Label**: Apply a Gmail label to the sent email
- **From**: Specify a custom sender name and email (e.g., "John Doe &lt;john.doe@gmail.com&gt;"). By default, the sender name and email is the one of the account used to connect to Gmail.
- **Reply To**: Set a different email address for replies
- **Thread ID**: Send email as a reply to an existing conversation thread

## Attachments

You can attach files to your Gmail emails by providing a variable that contains file URLs. The attachments can be:

- A single file URL (string)
- Multiple file URLs (array of strings)

<Warning>
  Gmail has a 25MB total attachment size limit. Make sure your combined
  attachments don't exceed this limit.
</Warning>

## Response Mapping

The Gmail block can save response data to variables:

- **Thread ID**: The conversation thread ID (useful for tracking email conversations)
