With the NocoDB block, you can create, update or get data from your NocoDB tables.

## How to find my `Table ID`?

To find your `Table ID`, you need to go to your NocoDB dashboard and click on the 3 dots button next to your table name.

## Search Records

This action allows you to search for existing records in a table. It requires your `Table ID` and can optionally take a `View ID` to search in a specific view.

You can configure the filter to return `All`, `First`, `Last` or `Random` found records.

Then all you need to do is to map the found fields to variables that you can re-use on your bot.
