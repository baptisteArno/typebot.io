## Create Message

With the Anthropic block, you can create chat messages based on your user queries and display the answer back to your typebot using Claude AI.

Similarly to the OpenAI block, this integration comes with a convenient message type called **Dialogue**. It allows you to easily pass a sequence of saved assistant / user messages history to Claude AI:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/blocks/integrations/anthropic/append-to-history.png"
    alt="Claude AI messages sequence"
  />
</Frame>

Then you can give the Claude AI block access to this sequence of messages:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/blocks/integrations/anthropic/dialogue-usage.png"
    alt="Claude AI messages sequence"
  />
</Frame>

Finally, save the response of the assistant to a variable in order to append it in the chat history and also display it on your typebot.

  />
