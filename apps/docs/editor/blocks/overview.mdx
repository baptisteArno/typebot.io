Blocks are the atomic building blocks of a typebot chat. You can chain any blocks together to create complexe conversation flows. When you drag and drop a block in the typebot flow, by default it will be inserted into a group that can have a title. Blocks are always contained in groups.

There are multiple block categories to make it easier to find the right block for your needs:

## Bubbles

Bubble blocks are used to show bubbles that can be used to display information to the user.

## Inputs

Input blocks are used to ask the user for input. It will stop the conversation and for the user to provide input.

## Logic

Logic blocks are used to perform background operations. They are not visible to the users.

Integration blocks are used to trigger external services operations.
