The Cards input block allows you to display a list of cards in a carousel.

A card can contain an image, a title, a description and several buttons.

## Display cards from variables

To display cards dynamically from variables. Make sure you have list variables. For example:

- `{{Images}}` => `["https://example.com/image1.png", "https://example.com/image2.png", "https://example.com/image3.png"]`
- `{{Titles}}` => `["Card 1", "Card 2", "Card 3"]`
- `{{Descriptions}}` => `["Description 1", "Description 2", "Description 3"]`

Simply add those variables to a single card in the flow editor and the 3 cards will be displayed in the bot.
