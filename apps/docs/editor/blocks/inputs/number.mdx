The Number input block allows you to ask your user for a number. You can configure a minimum, a maximum and a step:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Flow">
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/blocks/inputs/number-flow.png"
        alt="Number input in flow"
        className="rounded-lg"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bot">
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/blocks/inputs/number-bot.png"
        alt="Number input in bot"
        className="rounded-lg"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Format

This only affects how the number is displayed to the user when he submitted the answer in a bot.

You can choose the format for the captured number. By default, the number is formatted as a decimal value following user's locale preferences. You can override this behavior to format it as a currency, a percentage, a scientific number, etc.
