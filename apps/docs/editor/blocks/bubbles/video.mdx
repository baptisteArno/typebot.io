The Video bubble block allows you to display a video to your user. You can paste a video URL from many sources including YouTube, Vimeo, and mp4.

  <Tab title="Flow">
    <Frame style={{ maxWidth: '400px' }}>
      <img
        src="/images/blocks/bubbles/video.png"
        alt="Video bubble"
        className="rounded-lg"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bot">
    <video
      controls
      autoPlay
      className="rounded-lg"
      src="/images/blocks/bubbles/video-chat.mp4"
    ></video>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Video service detection

When you paste a video URL, Typbot will automatically detect the video service and parse it with the proper iframe settings. It currently works with:

- YouTube (video and shorts)
- Vimeo
- TikTok
- Gumlet
- OneDrive

Feel free to [suggest a missing service in the feedback board](https://feedback.typebot.io/).

For missing services, you can instead add an Embed bubble and paste the iframe code.

### Limitations

- YouTube clips are not supported as we can't transform it to embed URL automatically. To embed a YouTube clip, you can use the [Embed bubble](/editor/blocks/bubbles/embed) and paste the iframe code that can be found in Youtube under the "Share" > "Embed" button.
