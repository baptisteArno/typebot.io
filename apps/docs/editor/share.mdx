Your sniper flow can be publicly shared. For this, open the Share menu and enable the `Make the flow publicly available` option:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/share.png" alt="Share menu" />
</Frame>

The flow can then be tested by non-authenticated guests. They are able to check all the options and can play the bot in preview mode.
