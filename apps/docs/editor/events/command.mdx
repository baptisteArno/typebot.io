title: Command Event
---

This event allows you to trigger a specifc flow when a command is sent to the bot. This command can be sent with an HTTP request with a `command` message type on the `continueChat` endpoint or with the `Typebot.sendCommand` function if your bot is embedded on a website.

You assign a unique command name for each node and you can optionally resume the flow after the command is sent.
