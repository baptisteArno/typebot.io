title: Command
---

This event allows you to trigger a specifc flow when a command is sent to the bot. This command can be sent with an [continueChat HTTP request](/api-reference/chat/continue-chat) with a `command` message type or with the [Typebot.sendCommand](/deploy/web/html-javascript#commands) function if your bot is embedded on a website.

You assign a unique command name for each node and you can optionally resume the flow after the command is sent.
