### How to find my `typebotId`

If you'd like to execute the typebot in preview mode, you will need to provide the ID of the building typebot available in the editor URL:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/api/typebotId.png" alt="Get typebot ID" />
</Frame>

### How to find my `publicId`

For published typebot execution, you need to provide the public typebot ID available here:

<img src="/images/api/publicId.png" alt="Get typebot ID" />

### How to find my `workspaceId`

In your workspace dashboard, head over to `Settings & Members > Workspace > Settings` and copy the workspace ID

### How to handle stream

If you enabled stream, whenever a AI message should be streamed, you will receive that kind of JSON response:

```json
{
  "messages": [],
  "clientSideActions": [
    {
      "type": "stream",
      "stream": true,
      "expectsDedicatedReply": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The bot is ready to accept the message streaming. You now need to send the following query:

```sh
curl -X POST https://typebot.co/api/v2/sessions/{sessionId}/streamMessage
```

Where `{sessionId}` should be replaced by the session ID you got from the start chat response.

This endpoint will send Server-Sent events with all the information to display the streamed message.

Once it is done, you can contine the flow by sending a [continue chat request](./chat/continue-chat) with the streamed message as the message content.
