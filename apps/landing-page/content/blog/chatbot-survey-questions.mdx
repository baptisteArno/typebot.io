Chatbot surveys are transforming online feedback collection. Traditional surveys feel boring and time-consuming. In contrast, **chatbot surveys engage users interactively** and boost response rates.

This guide will help you create effective chatbot survey questions that:

- Gather meaningful **customer insights**
- Support **market research** efforts
- Collect valuable **product feedback**
- Test new **product concepts**

Learn how to craft questions that convert and deliver the data you need from your customers.

## What Are Chatbot Surveys and Why Should You Use Them?

<Image src="/blog-assets/chatbot-survey-questions/chat-asking-2-questions.avif" alt="Chat asking 2 questions" width="1103px" height="301px"  />


**Chatbot surveys** [collect feedback](./how-to-collect-customer-reviews.mdx) through interactive, conversational interfaces. They differ from traditional forms by:

1. **Presenting questions** one at a time
2. Creating a **dialogue-like experience**
3. **Mimicking a conversation** with a **real person**

Unlike standard surveys that display all questions at once, chatbot surveys feel more **personal and engaging**.

This happens because the conversational format feels less overwhelming and more engaging to respondents. The bot can also ask follow-up questions based on previous answers, making the survey experience more personal and relevant.

<Info>
The biggest advantage of using a chatbot for surveys is the improved response rate. Studies show that chatbot surveys [can increase completion rates by 40%](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chatbot-survey-response-rates-vs-traditional-surveys-nordmark) compared to traditional online surveys.
</Info>

## Key Benefits of Using Chatbot Surveys for Feedback Collection

Using **chatbot surveys** [offers several advantages](./benefits-ai-chatbot.mdx) over traditional survey methods. First, they reduce survey fatigue by presenting questions one at a time in a friendly, conversational way. This approach helps keep respondents engaged throughout the entire survey process.

Chatbot surveys offer multiple advantages:

1. They collect both **structured data** (ratings, multiple-choice) and open-ended feedback in one conversation.
2. The conversational format **encourages users to provide more detailed responses** to open questions, delivering richer insights.
3. They **gather feedback in real-time**, so you can collect and analyze data much faster than traditional survey methods.

## How to Create a Chatbot Survey: Step-by-Step Guide

<Image src="/blog-assets/chatbot-survey-questions/survey-chatbot-creation-flowchart.avif" alt="Survey chatbot creation flowchart" width="1200px" height="745px"  />


Creating an effective chatbot survey doesn't have to be complicated. Here's how to build a survey chatbot from scratch:

1. **Define your goals**: Identify what insights you want to gather
2. **Choose your platform**: Select a tool like Typebot that meets your needs
3. **Design your flow**: Create a logical path with branching based on responses
4. **Write conversational questions**: Use natural language that feels engaging
5. **Test with a small group**: Get feedback before wide release
6. **Analyze and improve**: Study the responses and refine your survey

With platforms like Typebot, you don't need any coding skills to create a professional survey chatbot. The [drag-and-drop interface](./best-chatbot-builder.mdx) makes it easy to build complex survey flows with branching logic and personalized responses.

## Types of Survey Questions to Include in Your Chatbot

<Image src="/blog-assets/chatbot-survey-questions/chatbot-survey-industry-examples.avif" alt="Chatbot survey Industry Examples" width="800px" height="600px"  />


The types of questions you include in your chatbot survey will depend on your goals. Here are some common question types that work well in conversational surveys:

### Scale Questions

Scale questions measure customer satisfaction with simple ratings. For example:

*"On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate our customer support?"*

These questions provide quantifiable data while being easy for respondents to answer quickly.

### Multiple-Choice Questions

Multiple-choice questions give respondents clear options to choose from. These work well for gathering specific information without overwhelming users. The chatbot can then branch to different follow-up questions based on the response.

### Open-Ended Questions

[Open-ended questions](./chatbot-script-examples.mdx) let respondents share detailed feedback using their own words. These questions provide valuable qualitative insights and help you discover:

- Issues you hadn't considered
- Problems you might have missed
- Feedback you didn't think to ask about directly

<Success>
According to [recent research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367098888_Comparing_Chatbots_and_Online_Surveys_for_Longitudinal_Data_Collection_An_Investigation_of_Response_Characteristics_Data_Quality_and_User_Evaluation), 72% of users find chatbot surveys more engaging than email or form-based surveys.
</Success>

### Measuring Chatbot Effectiveness with Usability Metrics

To ensure your chatbot survey is truly effective, you need ways to measure its usability. The **Chatbot Usability Questionnaire** (**CUQ**) is a **specialized tool** developed by **Ulster University** to evaluate chatbot interfaces.

The **CUQ** measures usability on a scale of 1-100 and includes both positive and negative statements to get balanced feedback. Questions focus on ease of use, navigation, understanding, and overall satisfaction with the chatbot experience.

Some key metrics to measure in your chatbot surveys include:

- **Task completion rate**: Can users complete what they set out to do?
- **Time-to-completion**: How long does it take users to finish the survey?
- **Error rate**: How often do users need to rephrase questions or inputs?
- **User satisfaction**: How do users feel about the interaction?

By tracking these metrics, you can identify **bottlenecks** in your chatbot survey flow and **make improvements** that lead to **higher completion rates** and **better data quality**.

## Best Practices for Writing Effective Chatbot Survey Questions

Writing good survey questions is critical to getting useful responses. First, keep your questions short and simple. Long, complex questions can confuse respondents and lead to inaccurate answers.

**Focus on one topic per question**. Asking about multiple elements (like "*How satisfied are you with our product quality and customer service?*") will yield unclear results. Keep each question specific to get actionable feedback.

Use **conversational language** that sounds **natural**. Skip formal phrasing like "*Please rate your level of satisfaction with our services.*" Instead, try something more casual:

*"How happy are you with our service?*

Also, be careful with the **order** of your questions. Start with **simple, engaging** questions before moving to more complex or personal ones. This approach **builds trust** and keeps respondents engaged throughout the survey.

<Warning>
**Pro Tip:** Avoid asking personal questions early in your chatbot survey. Build trust first with simple questions before asking for more sensitive information.
</Warning>

## Using AI-Powered Chatbots to Improve Survey Response Rates

[**AI chatbots**](./build-ai-chatbot-with-custom-knowledge-base.mdx) create more engaging survey experiences and improve response rates. These advanced systems go beyond basic scripted conversations to create truly personalized experiences.

### How AI Enhances Survey Chatbots

Modern AI-powered survey chatbots can:

- Understand **natural language** and conversational cues
- **Respond intelligently** to unexpected user questions during surveys
- Adapt their **tone and style** to match respondents
- Use **sentiment analysis** to detect frustration and adjust the survey flow
- Generate **personalized follow-up** questions based on previous answers
- **Summarize and analyze** qualitative responses in real-time

### AI-Optimized Question Selection

One of the most powerful applications of AI in survey chatbots is **dynamic question selection**. AI can:

- **Skip irrelevant questions** based on user profiles or previous responses
- **Identify** when a respondent is getting fatigued and adjust question complexity
- **Prioritize questions** that will yield the most valuable insights for your specific goals
- **Test different question** phrasings and learn which gets better response rates

For example, AI chatbots can detect negative user responses. When this happens, they might skip less important questions. **This adaptive approach significantly improves completion rates** by preventing survey abandonment.

## Case Study: How YTK Used Chatbot Surveys to Improve Customer Experience

During the COVID-19 pandemic, **YTK** (a Finnish unemployment fund) faced a huge problem. Customer questions jumped by 300%, and they needed a way to handle all these requests while still giving good service.

YTK decided to use a chatbot on their website to help. This chatbot could answer common questions, guide people through processes, and ask for feedback - all through **simple conversations** that felt **natural**.

The results were impressive:

- The chatbot handled **71% of all customer conversations** (up from 66% before)
- Monthly customer **feedback increased from 66 to 188** responses
- Customer satisfaction **remained strong at 8.3/10** despite the crisis

What makes this example so powerful is how the chatbot collected much more feedback than traditional surveys. By [asking questions](./lead-qualification-questions.mdx) during natural conversations, more people shared their thoughts. The chatbot made giving feedback quick and easy, so people *actually* did it.

YTK's success demonstrates why chatbot surveys outperform traditional methods like emails or forms. Here's why they're effective:

- They appear at the **precise moment of customer interaction**
- They require **minimal time investment**
- They feel **conversational**, not like tedious paperwork

[This case study](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/getjenny_saves-time-during-crisis-ytk-chatbot-case-activity-7024312991898607616-so2N/) reveals that chatbot surveys do more than increase response rates. They **generate higher-quality, actionable customer feedback** that empowers companies to make meaningful improvements.
