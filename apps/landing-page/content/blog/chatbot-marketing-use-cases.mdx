## Top of funnel (awareness & discovery)

Use chatbots to engage visitors, qualify interest, and capture contacts before they leave your site. Here are practical **ways to turn cold traffic into engaged prospects**.

### 1. Social media engagement bots

<Image src="/blog-assets/chatbot-marketing-use-cases/whatsapp-chat-support-conversation-example.avif" alt="Whatsapp Chat Support Conversation Example" width="970px" height="1200px"  />


A chatbot on Instagram, Facebook, or WhatsApp responds instantly to messages and comments. It answers product questions and guides users to your site or offers.

How to use it:

- Send automated conversational replies (for example, pricing questions lead to your pricing calculator).
- Ask [qualifying questions](./lead-qualification-questions.mdx) to determine fit, then provide tailored answers or book a demo.
- Capture emails and segment interests during the chat.
- Escalate to a human when personal attention is needed.

Once deployed, use the bot across channels. Track its performance with built-in analytics. (Typebot supports WhatsApp integration.)

### 2. Contest and giveaway automation

<Typebot typebot="giveaway-entry-viral-loop-bot-zy6kvdw" />

A giveaway bot collects and validates entries without spreadsheets. It saves time and turns entrants into promoters.

Key features include:

- Validating requirements such as email, social follow, and age, then confirming participation.
- Offering unique referral links for bonus entries and tracking referrals in real time.
- Syncing entrants to your email platform and segmenting them with conditional logic for targeted follow-ups.

You end up with a **segmented list of engaged prospects** who already know your brand.

### 3. Email list growth and segmentation

<Typebot typebot="smart-lead-magnet-segmentation-bot-3f5j053" />

Replace static lead magnets with a short, conversational flow that captures richer data and improves conversion.

A recommended flow:

- Offer the asset (ebook, checklist, template), then ask 2–3 segmentation questions like role, biggest challenge, or topics of interest.
- Deliver the content instantly and tag subscribers in your email platform based on their answers.
- Sync responses to tools like Google Sheets, Airtable, or automation platforms (Make, Zapier) to trigger tailored campaigns.

This approach feels personal to the user and provides **actionable segmentation for follow-up**.

### 4. Event promotion and registration

<Typebot typebot="event-registration-rsvp-bot-ylt0eau" />

Make registration conversational by sharing agenda highlights, qualifying interest, and collecting details naturally.

The bot can:

- Explain the agenda and speakers, and ask attendees why they want to participate.
- Recommend sessions or ticket types based on role or interests.
- Send calendar invites and schedule reminder messages.
- Integrate with Cal.com for scheduling or connect to Zoom and Eventbrite via webhooks.
- Capture attendee data for segmentation and follow up post-event for feedback.

This process achieves higher completion rates and **better qualified attendees** because it feels like a helpful conversation, not a form.

## Middle of funnel (Consideration & evaluation)

### 5. Lead generation and qualification

<Typebot typebot="lead-generation-real-estate-ouhqug5" />

Not every visitor is ready to buy. Some browse, others compare, and only a few are true prospects. A lead qualification chatbot **separates casual browsers from sales-ready opportunities without immediate human involvement.**

Start with basic questions like name, email, and company. Then ask strategic qualifying questions about budget range, timeline, pain points, and team size. Score responses in real time. Route high scores to sales through Slack or CRM. Lower scores receive educational nurturing content.

Capture contact data early to prevent visitors from disappearing. Filter leads so sales teams focus only on real potential. For example, separate those with “no budget” and “just researching” from those with “approved budget” and “ready within 30 days.”

Use a [multi-step flow](./how-to-create-multi-step-form-in-webflow.mdx) that builds trust before asking sensitive questions. Treat it like a natural sales conversation, not an interrogation. Define clear scoring thresholds and routing rules. Integrate with CRM and communication tools to automate handoffs and follow-ups.

### 6. Product recommendations and guided selling

<Typebot typebot="shopify-product-recommendation-quiz-ydm5odp" />

Customers often know the problem but not the exact product. A [recommendation quiz](./how-to-create-a-product-recommendation-quiz-shopify.mdx) **translates customer needs into a short list of fitting products.**

Ask about the customer’s goal, constraints, and must-have features. Use conditional logic to return two or three product matches with images, short descriptions, and direct purchase links. Include a “Not quite right?” option to restart the quiz or connect to a human for help.

This approach reduces overwhelm, guides decision-making, and works for both simple and complex catalogs.

### 7. Pricing and quote automation

<Typebot typebot="interactive-pricing-calculator-website-design-f9d8zbl" />

Back-and-forth on pricing kills momentum. A conversational pricing calculator helps prospects move from inquiry to a detailed quote in minutes.

Build a flow to collect project scope, required features, timeline, and team size. Use answers in your pricing formulas. Show users a detailed breakdown with line items and package comparisons (basic, professional, enterprise). Capture contact info and offer a PDF quote emailed to the prospect.

Immediate, transparent pricing **eliminates delays and reduces friction.** Package comparisons help prospects understand value across different tiers. Automation maintains momentum and simplifies follow-up.

### 8. Customer feedback and review collection

<Typebot typebot="saa-s-feedback-bot-lrsbwg7" />

Timing and simplicity matter when [collecting feedback](./feedback-chatbot.mdx). Trigger a short [chatbot survey](./chatbot-survey-questions.mdx) right after purchase or service completion when the experience is fresh.

Use a quick rating scale (1–10 or emoji). Branch responses based on scores:

- Promoters (9–10): request public reviews with links to sites like Google or Trustpilot
- Satisfied (7–8): ask what could improve their experience
- Detractors (1–6): escalate to support for immediate remediation

Integrate responses into your CRM to spot trends at scale. For example, if many neutral responses mention shipping times, it signals an operational issue. This method **increases response rates, surfaces actionable insights, and prevents negative reviews by addressing problems early.**

## Bottom of funnel (conversion)

### Abandoned cart recovery

<Typebot typebot="abandoned-cart-recovery-bot-yf7lwot" />

Cart abandonment occurs when a customer pauses a purchase. Chatbots restart the conversation while the customer's intent remains strong.

The abandoned cart bot works by:

- Triggering when a visitor leaves checkout or becomes idle for a few minutes.
- Reopening the dialogue with a simple prompt, such as "Still thinking about these items?" It also shows product images and prices from the cart.
- Addressing objections immediately by explaining shipping thresholds, return policies, and alternative payment options.
- Asking which item the customer is unsure about and offering more details or alternatives.
- Qualifying hesitation before offering discounts to avoid unnecessary margin loss.
- Maintaining continuity by using email links that reopen the same conversation, so the bot remembers past interactions.

This approach converts well because it resolves concerns instantly instead of relying on delayed emails. Using personalized cart data keeps the experience relevant and actionable. Plus, the focused, conversational style recovers sales that generic reminders often miss.

### Drip campaign execution

Chat-based drip campaigns transform fixed broadcasts into adaptive, behavior-driven conversations.

Instead of fixed intervals, the bot tracks engagement and adjusts messages based on user actions. It delivers immediate value with resources or questions, then follows up appropriately.

The bot branches conversations depending on user behavior:

- Engaged users receive product-focused content.
- Passive users get nurturing designed to reengage them.
- Active inquirers trigger faster, more direct follow-ups.

Data capture happens progressively by asking small, natural questions across interactions. This gathers information about role, company size, and pain points without overwhelming customers with long forms.

Hybrid timing lets the bot both react in real time (like when visiting a pricing page) and schedule follow-ups. This creates conditional branches within one flow for better personalization.

This method works because conversations reduce friction compared with clicks and static emails. The sequence adapts to each person’s pace and interests, making follow-ups feel helpful rather than mechanical.

## Post-purchase (retention & advocacy)

Acquiring a customer is just the beginning. Onboarding, engaging, and turning buyers into repeat customers and advocates drives lasting value. **Chatbots provide timely, personalized experiences at scale without burdening your team.**

### Customer onboarding

<Typebot typebot="interactive-onboarding-checklist-luccp4f" />

The first days after purchase are critical. A well-designed onboarding bot **reduces buyer’s remorse, lowers returns, and improves long-term retention.**

The bot can:

- Confirm orders and instantly share tracking information.
- Guide customers through setup or first steps, adjusting for physical or digital products.
- For physical goods, ask delivery preferences, answer assembly questions, and proactively address likely problems before they require support.
- For digital products, help with account setup, highlight features based on customer goals, and provide tutorials or quick-start guides on demand.
- Offer tailored recommendations by asking one focused question to avoid overwhelming users.

This conversational, contextual onboarding builds confidence, lowers early churn, and boosts the chance that customers become power users.

### Post-purchase engagement and upselling

<Typebot typebot="post-purchase-upsell-onboarding-bot-k8qohuy" />

Timing and relevance determine the success of post-purchase offers. An engagement bot follows up after customers use a product and suggests helpful, personalized upsells.

It operates by:

- Checking in conversationally on the customer’s experience and resolving issues.
- Using conditional logic to recommend complementary products that address real needs, such as suggesting recovery tools after learning about training routines.
- Detecting upgrade opportunities for subscriptions based on usage, feature requests, or milestones, then offering premium benefits suited to the customer.
- Integrating with your ecommerce platform or CRM to access purchase history, generate dynamic recommendations, and apply targeted bundle discounts.

This method frames [upsells](./upsell-using-ai-chatbot.mdx) as useful solutions, not aggressive sales pitches, keeping the interaction natural within the ongoing conversation.

## Emerging trends and technologies

### Voice and GenAI conversational elements

Voice is becoming a practical channel alongside text. People speak faster than they type. On mobile, voice feels more natural. Expect more hands-free product searches, voice-activated promotions, and audio feedback collection.

**Modern voice bots handle context, sentiment, and complex queries instead of rigid commands**. GenAI goes beyond scripted paths. It generates contextually relevant responses from open-ended user input. For example, it can interpret “I need something professional but not boring” into meaningful product suggestions.

A hybrid design works well. Use structured flows for contact capture. Let GenAI manage nuanced, free-form questions.

**Personalization scales with GenAI: one AI-driven bot can adapt tone, pace, and recommendations to each visitor’s style**. Provide quick answers for direct users and deeper guidance for exploratory ones.

Combining voice and AI adds realistic audio, making interactions feel less mechanical and more accessible. ElevenLabs provides examples of this technology.

Platforms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral AI let you add generative capabilities quickly.

### The future of chatbot marketing

Chatbots are evolving from support tools to primary customer interfaces. Here are the key trends shaping this shift.

**Deeper data integration means bots use purchase history, browsing behavior, and communication preferences** to continue conversations mid-context. For instance, they can offer “Ready to reorder your usual?” instead of starting from zero.

Conversations will follow users across channels. You can start on a website and continue on WhatsApp without repeating information. Multi-platform deployment is becoming standard.

Bots will engage predictively and proactively by triggering actions based on behavior. If a user lingers on pricing, the bot surfaces a comparison. Returning users might receive offers for demos or discounts.

Beyond answering questions, **bots will analyze interaction patterns to reveal which objections block deals, predict purchase intent, and determine which messages work best for each segment**.

Bots will manage more complex tasks before handing off to humans. The focus will be on deciding which marketing aspects truly need human judgment and which can be automated without losing effectiveness.
