Customer conversations now happen in chat apps, at 2 AM on WhatsApp, during lunch on Facebook Messenger, and between meetings. Email and display ads are easier to ignore. Chatbots connect with people where they already spend time and respond instantly.

Gartner predicts that by 2027, chatbots will become the main customer service channel for about 25% of businesses. Brands like Domino’s and Starbucks are already building full experiences around chatbots.

This change is not about replacing humans. It’s about delivering speed, relevance, and continuity. Plus, responding conversationally while remembering preferences and feeling helpful, not robotic.

## **Real-World Chatbot Marketing Examples That Convert**

The most successful chatbot implementations share a common thread. They solve real customer problems while driving measurable business results.

### **4.** Turtle Bay Resort

When Turtle Bay Resort in Hawaii needed to modernize its guest experience and streamline its operations. They turned to chatbot automation.

The hospitality brand faced a logistical challenge. High volumes of guest inquiries across multiple channels like website chat, live chat, Google Business Messages. Plus, a new reopening environment.

Their chatbot strategy unified all guest communication channels. It automated inquiries and made direct bookings easy. It also captured leads around the clock.

They set up chat flows on the resort website and messaging channels. Guests could check availability and get quotes. They could also book directly and ask questions through the chatbot. No phone calls, no waiting.

### 5. The Wall Street Journal Chatbot

[By 2019, the Barista Bot handled 10%](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2019/q3/CALLSTREET-REPORT_-Starbucks-Corp-SBUX-US-Q3-2019-Earnings-Call-25-July-2019-5_00-PM-ET-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) of U.S. mobile orders, representing millions of transactions.

They meet users on their preferred platforms rather than forcing downloads or redirects. They balance automation with personalization by remembering context and preferences. And critically, they know when to hand off to humans for complex issues that require empathy or expertise.

## **Chatbot Marketing Use Cases: From Awareness to Advocacy**

Before diving into real-world examples, it's important to understand where chatbots fit in your marketing strategy. Modern chatbots serve distinct purposes at every stage of the customer journey. From capturing cold traffic to turning buyers into brand advocates.

Here are three core use cases that drive measurable results:

### **Lead Generation and Qualification**

Not every visitor is ready to buy. Lead qualification chatbots separate casual browsers from sales-ready opportunities by asking strategic questions. These questions are about budget, timeline, pain points, and team size.

<Typebot typebot="lead-generation-real-estate-ouhqug5" />

They score responses in real time, routing high-value leads to sales while nurturing lower scores with educational content. Filtering prospects so your sales team focuses only on real opportunities.

### **Product Recommendations and Guided Selling**

Customers often know the problem but not the exact product. Recommendation quizzes ask about goals, constraints, and must-have features. Then use conditional logic to return 2-3 product matches with images, descriptions, and purchase links.

<Typebot typebot="shopify-product-recommendation-quiz-ydm5odp" />

This reduces overwhelm and guides decision-making for both simple and complex catalogs, turning browsing into buying.

### **Abandoned Cart Recovery**

Cart abandonment bots trigger when visitors leave checkout, reopening dialogue with "Still thinking about these items?". They show cart contents, address objections about shipping or returns, and qualify hesitation before offering discounts.

<Typebot typebot="abandoned-cart-recovery-bot-yf7lwot" />

This personalized approach recovers sales that generic email reminders miss. Also, it converts up to 3x more abandoned carts than traditional email campaigns.

## Build Your Own Marketing Chatbot with Typebot

You don’t need large budgets or an engineering team to launch a conversion-focused chatbot. With a clear use case and the right platform, conversational experiences become a strategic tool instead of a technical burden.

### Why conversational marketing outperforms traditional forms

Conversational flows collect information naturally. Instead of overwhelming visitors with multiple fields at once, a bot asks the right question at the right time. This helps users progress smoothly without feeling interrupted.

Conversational forms achieve 2 to 3 times higher completion rates than static forms. Because, each step logically follows the previous answer.

Bots also adapt in real time. First-time visitors, returning customers, and enterprise prospects receive tailored paths instead of a generic form.

Deploying chatbots in familiar places like chat widgets, WhatsApp, or social DMs reduces friction and expands reach. This avoids forcing users to install apps or complete long forms.

### How Typebot simplifies chatbot creation for marketers

Typebot’s visual builder offers drag-and-drop blocks for text, inputs, buttons, and conditional logic. This lets non-technical teams design flows quickly.

It includes native integrations with Google Sheets, webhooks, CRM platforms, email notifications, calendar booking (Cal.com). Also, OpenAI for smarter responses, and Stripe for in-bot payments.

You can embed rich media like images, videos, or PDFs, and customize colors, fonts, avatars, and messaging style.

Flexible deployment options include widgets, popups, full-page experiences, shareable links, or API/WhatsApp delivery.

Analytics features help you track drop-off points, completion rates, and export responses. You can also run A/B tests to improve performance continuously.

### Getting started with your first marketing bot

Begin by defining one clear objective, such as:

- [Qualifying leads](./automated-lead-qualification.mdx)
- Booking demos
- [Recommending products](./how-to-create-a-product-recommendation-quiz-shopify.mdx)
- [Collecting feedback](./collecting-customer-feedback-methods.mdx)

Map the conversation on paper starting with a greeting. Then, followed by key questions, the desired outcome, and branches for common detours.

Build the “happy path” first. This should be a clean, frictionless flow from start to goal.

Then add branches for edge cases, like users not ready to buy, enterprise interest, or requests for help. Tag or route these appropriately.

Connect integrations early so captured data flows directly to your CRM, sheets, or email.

Test thoroughly by checking multiple paths, mobile responsiveness, and integration functionality. Iterate to clarify confusing steps.

Deploy your chatbot strategically where friction occurs, such as pricing pages, checkout, or feature pages. Monitor analytics and refine weekly.

Start small, focus on results, and improve over time. A well-tested chatbot will outperform an overbuilt one and provide a repeatable playbook to scale conversational marketing.
