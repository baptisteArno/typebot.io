WhatsApp Business API is revolutionizing customer connections. Unlike traditional cart-abandonment emails with only 20% open rates, WhatsApp reminders reach 90% within 30 minutes. That's why forward-thinking companies are switching to WhatsApp for customer communication.

## What is WhatsApp Business API?
