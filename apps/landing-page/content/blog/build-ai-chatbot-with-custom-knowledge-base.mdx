Creating an **AI assistant tailored to your business** can streamline operations and improve customer support. By integrating tools like Flowise and Typebot with your own knowledge base, you can develop a chatbot that provides accurate, context-aware responses. This approach ensures **data privacy and eliminates risks like hallucination** or exposing sensitive information to public models.

Whether you're building an internal tool for your team or a customer-facing support bot, this guide will show you how to use your existing documentation in Notion and **leverage AI advancements**—all without needing to write code.

## Understanding AI Chatbots and Custom Knowledge Bases

Businesses increasingly rely on **AI chatbots with custom knowledge bases** to deliver intelligent, context-aware interactions. Before diving into implementation, it’s essential to understand the core components and how they work together.

### What is an AI Chatbot?

An AI chatbot is a software application that uses artificial intelligence to simulate human-like conversations. Unlike traditional rule-based chatbots that follow rigid decision trees, modern AI chatbots leverage large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. This allows them to understand context, generate natural responses, and handle complex queries with flexibility.

In this guide, we’ll use two [open-source tools](./open-source-chatbots.mdx): **Flowise** and **Typebot**. Flowise connects to various LLMs to handle AI processing, while Typebot provides an intuitive interface for creating conversational flows without coding.

### What is a Custom Knowledge Base?

A custom knowledge base is a structured collection of information tailored to your organization, products, or domain. It acts as a **centralized repository of knowledge** and may include:

- Product documentation and specifications
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
- Internal policies and procedures
- Customer support articles
- Technical documentation
- Sales and marketing materials

Unlike generic knowledge bases, a custom knowledge base is curated to meet your specific needs, ensuring responses are accurate and relevant.

### Why Combine AI Chatbots with Custom Knowledge Bases?

Integrating AI chatbots with custom knowledge bases creates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**, [offering several advantages](./benefits-ai-chatbot.mdx):

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Responses are grounded in your verified knowledge base, reducing the risk of hallucinated or outdated information.
2. **Contextual Relevance**: The chatbot can access specific details about your organization, products, or services, leading to more helpful interactions.
3. **Lower Training Costs**: Instead of fine-tuning an entire language model, you can simply update your knowledge base with new information.
4. **Controlled Responses**: You maintain control over the source of information, ensuring compliance with company policies and reducing errors.

In the next sections, we’ll explore how to build this system using Flowise and Typebot. Whether you aim to enhance customer support, streamline internal processes, or create a personal knowledge assistant, this guide will help you achieve your goals.

## The Different Types of Knowledge Base Chatbots
