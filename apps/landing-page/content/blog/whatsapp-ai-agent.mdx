This example illustrates how a WhatsApp AI agent can streamline operations, lighten the load on human staff, and enhance the overall guest experience.

In the following sections, we’ll explore how to build such an agent step-by-step. We'll start with the basics and progress to advanced strategies.

## Getting Started: Building Your First WhatsApp AI Agent with Typebot

Creating a WhatsApp AI agent might seem complex. However, with tools like Typebot and Flowise, you can build a powerful chatbot without coding. This section guides you through [setting up a basic WhatsApp chatbot](./create-whatsapp-chatbot.mdx) and enhancing it with advanced capabilities using Flowise.

### Creating a Basic WhatsApp Chatbot Using Typebot

Typebot is a no-code platform that allows you to design conversational flows easily. Here’s how to create a basic [WhatsApp chatbot](./best-whatsapp-chatbot.mdx):

#### Set Up Your Typebot Account

To begin, **visit [Typebot](/) and create an account.** Once logged in:

- Click **"Create a Typebot"** and select a blank template.
- Name your bot (e.g., "Hotel Assistant") to reflect its purpose.

#### Design the Conversation Flow

Start with a friendly introduction as your **welcome message**. For example: *"Hi! Welcome to [Your Hotel Name]. I’m here to assist you with bookings, FAQs, and more. How can I help you today?"*

Next, add an **Input Block** to capture user queries. Save the input in a variable (e.g., `user_message`). Use a **Text Block** to display responses. For now, you can add static responses like: *"Thank you for your question! I’ll get back to you shortly."*

#### Connect to WhatsApp

To connect to WhatsApp, utilize the native WhatsApp integration of Typebot to link your Typebot chatbot directly to WhatsApp. You'll need to configure your WhatsApp settings to point to your Typebot endpoint.

At this stage, you have a basic chatbot that can greet users and capture their queries. Next, we’ll enhance its capabilities by integrating Flowise.

### Add Agents Using Flowise

Flowise acts as the backend for your chatbot. **It enables it to process user queries intelligently.** By connecting Flowise to Typebot, you can create a WhatsApp AI agent that retrieves information, performs tasks, and delivers personalized responses.

## Taking WhatsApp AI Agents Further: Advanced Strategies

### Creating a Pool of Specialized WhatsApp AI Agents for Complex Tasks

As businesses grow, so do the complexities of their customer interactions. A single chatbot may struggle to handle diverse queries effectively. This is where a **pool of specialized AI agents** comes into play. By dividing responsibilities among multiple agents, each tailored to a specific task, you can create a seamless and efficient user experience.

#### How It Works:

To create a pool of specialized AI agents, follow these steps:

1. **Master Brain Agent**: This central agent acts as a router. It analyzes user intent and directs queries to the appropriate specialized agent.
2. **Specialized Sub-Agents**: Each sub-agent is designed to handle a specific domain, such as booking, FAQs, or concierge services. These agents can use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge-based queries or function calling for task execution.

#### Example: Hotel AI Chatbot

Consider a [hotel chatbot](./ai-chatbot-for-hotels.mdx) with the following structure:

- **Master Brain Agent**: Routes user requests to the correct sub-agent.
- **Booking Agent**: Handles room reservations and availability checks.
- **FAQ Agent**: Answers questions about hotel policies and amenities using a knowledge base.
- **Concierge Agent**: Manages special requests like spa bookings or restaurant reservations.
- **Local Attractions Agent**: Provides recommendations and bookings for nearby tourist attractions, museums, events, and experiences.

<Image src="/blog-assets/whatsapp-ai-agent/example-chatbot-local-attractions-agent.avif" alt="Example Chatbot Local Attractions Agent" width="2270px" height="1601px" />


**This modular approach ensures that each query is handled by the most capable agent, improving accuracy and user satisfaction.**

### Automating Workflows and Tasks with AI-Powered WhatsApp Agents

To maximize efficiency, WhatsApp AI agents can automate repetitive workflows and tasks. By integrating **RAG and function calling**, these agents can retrieve information and execute actions seamlessly.

#### Implementing RAG for Knowledge Retrieval

RAG enables agents to pull contextually relevant information from a knowledge base. This ensures accurate and dynamic responses. For instance:

- A [FAQ Agent](./faq-chatbot.mdx) for a hotel could retrieve answers about check-in times, parking availability, or pet policies from a pre-built knowledge base in Notion.
- Using Flowise, you can connect the knowledge base to a vector database like Pinecone. This allows the agent to perform semantic searches and deliver precise answers.

#### Using Function Calling for Task Execution

Function calling allows agents to perform specific actions, such as booking a room or scheduling a spa appointment. For example:

- A **Booking Agent** could call a `checkRoomAvailability()` function to confirm room availability in real time.
- A **Concierge Agent** could use a `bookSpaAppointment()` function to schedule a massage for a guest.

**By combining RAG and function calling, your WhatsApp AI agents can handle both informational and actionable queries, creating a comprehensive solution for users.**

### Add a Master Brain Agent

The **Master Brain Agent** is the cornerstone of a multi-agent system. **It ensures that user queries are routed to the correct sub-agent, maintaining a smooth and intuitive experience.**

#### Step-by-Step: Building a Master Brain Agent

Here are the steps to build a Master Brain Agent:

1. **Set Up the Master Brain Agent**:
   - Use Typebot to create a chatbot flow for the Master Brain Agent.
   - Integrate OpenAI’s reasoning models (e.g., GPT-4-turbo or GPT-4-32k) to analyze user intent.
2. **Define Routing Logic**: configure the agent to classify user queries based on keywords, context, or intent.
3. **Enable Clarification Questions**:
   - If the intent is unclear, the Master Brain Agent can ask follow-up questions to refine the query. Example:
   - User: "I need help with my stay."
   - Master Brain Agent: "Could you clarify? Are you looking to book a room, ask a question, or make a special request?"
4. **Handoff to Sub-Agents**:
   - Once the intent is clear, the Master Brain Agent hands off the query to the appropriate sub-agent.
   - Use Typebot’s **Typebot Link** feature to seamlessly transition between agents while preserving context.

**This handoff ensures that users receive specialized assistance without confusion or delays.**

By implementing these advanced strategies, you can transform your WhatsApp AI agents into a robust, multi-functional system capable of handling complex tasks and workflows.
