WhatsApp has become the world's most popular messaging app with over 2.7 billion users, making it a goldmine for business communications. With **98% message open rates** and **45-60% response rates**, automated WhatsApp messaging can transform how you connect with your customers.

## What Are WhatsApp Business Automated Messages?

WhatsApp Business automated messages are pre-programmed responses that send automatically based on triggers, such as new contacts, time schedules, or customer actions.

These include greeting messages, away messages, quick replies, and [advanced chatbot](./whatsapp-chatbot-use-cases.mdx) sequences that can handle everything from order confirmations to customer support.

**There are two primary types:**

- **Basic automation** through the free WhatsApp Business App (greeting messages, away messages, quick replies). You type `/`and you get messages you saved as templates.
- **Advanced automation** via [WhatsApp Business API](./whatsapp-api-use-cases.mdx) (full chatbots, triggered workflows, template messaging)

The key difference: Business App automation requires manual sending of quick replies, while API automation enables true hands-off messaging at scale.

## Benefits: Why Automate WhatsApp Messages?

### Speed and efficiency transformation

Automated messages respond instantly, even outside business hours. Customers get immediate acknowledgment instead of waiting hours for human responses. This **reduces response time from hours to seconds**, dramatically improving customer satisfaction.

### 24/7 service availability

Your business never sleeps with automation. Customers can get information, place orders, and receive support anytime. Studies show **70% of customers expect responses within an hour** – automation makes this achievable without staffing costs.

### Conversion rate improvements

Businesses using WhatsApp automation see **20-60% higher conversion rates** compared to email marketing. The personal nature of messaging combined with instant delivery creates powerful engagement that drives sales.

### Operational cost savings

Automation handles **70-80% of routine inquiries** without human intervention. Companies typically see a **30-50% reduction in customer service costs** while maintaining higher satisfaction levels.

## Automation Options: Business App vs API vs Third-Party Tools

### WhatsApp Business App (Free)

Best for small businesses with basic needs that don't heavily rely on WhatsApp for their daily operations

**Capabilities:**

- Greeting messages for new contacts
- Away messages during off-hours
- Quick replies (up to 50 saved responses)
- Basic business profile automation

**Limitations:**

- Single device operation only
- Manual sending is required for quick replies
- No true chatbot capabilities
- Maximum 256 contacts per broadcast

### WhatsApp Business API

Best for large businesses needing advanced features. Here are its main capabilities:

- Unlimited automated messaging
- Advanced chatbot workflows
- Template messaging with approval
- CRM integration and team access
- Real-time analytics

**Limitations:**

- Requires WhatsApp Business API access, which involves setup, verification, and may include messaging fees
- Template messages must be pre-approved by WhatsApp, creating possible delays and requiring compliance with strict guidelines
- Integration setup can be complex for non-technical users
- Third-party platforms may have monthly chat, conversation, or contact limits on free or lower-cost tiers
- Data privacy depends on each provider’s security practices; careful vendor selection is important

### Third-Party Tools: Typebot and Alternatives

Best for small businesses and solo entrepreneurs who usually rely on WhatsApp for their business needs and want simple automation and messaging without complex setup.

**Typebot** stands out as the most cost-effective solution:

- **Open-source platform** with full transparency
- **Visual drag-and-drop builder** with 34+ building blocks
- **Free plan:** 200 chats/month with unlimited bots
- **5-minute setup** from signup to functional bot
- **AI integration** with OpenAI, Google, and other providers

**Other popular options:**

- [**ManyChat**](./manychat-alternatives.mdx)**:** Multi-channel automation starting at $15/month
- **Chatfuel:** AI-powered with ChatGPT integration at $19.99/month
- **Wati:** WhatsApp-focused BSP with no-code builder

## Setting Up Typebot with WhatsApp

<Image

  alt="Flow Chart Contact Name"
  width="1200px"
  height="1006px"
/>

Typebot offers the best of both worlds – advanced automation without the API complexity. It's open-source, costs less than most alternatives, and you can set it up in about 15 minutes.

### Why Typebot makes sense

The free plan gives you 200 chats per month with unlimited bots. The drag-and-drop builder has 45+ building blocks for creating conversations. You can connect it to AI tools like ChatGPT, and it works with WhatsApp Business API without the usual headaches.

### Creating your first chatbot

<Image

  alt="Typebot Setup Whatsapp"

  height="770px"

Sign up at [typebot.io](https://typebot.io) and start with their visual builder. Think of it like building with digital Lego blocks. Add text bubbles for messages, buttons for choices, input fields for collecting information, and conditional logic for smart responses.

Start simple with a basic customer service bot. Create a welcome message, add buttons for common questions like "Hours," "Pricing," and "Contact," then build response flows for each option. You can test everything in real-time as you build.

### Connecting to WhatsApp

This is where it gets a bit technical, but Typebot guides you through it. You'll need to create a Meta app first by going to [developers.facebook.com/apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and creating a new app. Choose "Business" as the app type and add the WhatsApp product.

Once your Meta app is ready, Typebot gives you a webhook URL and verification token. Copy these into your WhatsApp Developer Console. The platform walks you through each step, so you're not guessing what to do next.

After connecting, you can test your bot by sending a message to your WhatsApp Business number. If everything's working, your bot should respond according to the flow you built.

### Making it smarter

Typebot lets you connect external services through webhooks. You can link it to your CRM to update customer records, connect to payment systems for transactions, or integrate with Google Sheets to store responses. The possibilities expand as your needs grow.

## Best Practices & Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Essential best practices

When optimizing your content for WhatsApp Business messages, focus on keeping your messages concise while still delivering genuine value to your audience.

To further improve your outreach, consider the following best practices:

- Move beyond basic personalization; customize content based on recipients' specific preferences or behaviors, not just their first name.
- Always provide clear next steps or calls to action, ensuring recipients know exactly how to proceed.
- Test your automated message sequences thoroughly for clarity, intent, and engagement results before rolling them out.
- Maintain a consistent brand voice throughout every interaction to foster trust and recognition.

Applying these recommendations will help your WhatsApp Business messages perform more effectively and engage your users.

Timing also plays a key role in message effectiveness. Aim to send your communications during standard business hours, typically between 8 AM and 9 PM in your recipient’s local time.
