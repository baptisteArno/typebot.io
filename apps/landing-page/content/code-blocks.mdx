The code blocks on the documentation site and the blog are powered by [rehype-pretty-code](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code). The syntax highlighting is done using [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki).

It has the following features:

1. Beautiful code blocks with syntax highlighting.
2. Support for VS Code themes.
3. Works with hundreds of languages.
4. Line and word highlighting.
5. Support for line numbers.
6. Show code block titles using meta strings.

Thanks to Shiki, highlighting is done at build time. No JavaScript is sent to the client for runtime highlighting.

## Example

```ts {2,8-10} showLineNumbers title="./app.config.ts" 
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/start/config'
import viteTsConfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    plugins: [
      // this is the plugin that enables path aliases
      viteTsConfigPaths({
        projects: ['./tsconfig.json'],
      }),
    ],
  },
})
````
## Word highlight
```js /multiply/
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b
```

## Diff
```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b // [!code --]
const sub = (a, b) => a - b // [!code ++]
console.log("hello")
```
