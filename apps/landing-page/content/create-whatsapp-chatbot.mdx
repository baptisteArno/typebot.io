#### Incorporating Input Fields and Conditional Logic

Gather valuable information from your users by including input fields for text, email, phone numbers, and more. Typebot also allows you to implement conditional logic, ensuring that your chatbot responds intelligently based on user input.

### Real example of a Whatsapp Chatbot

Let's walk through the creation of a feedback chatbot that not only gathers valuable insights but also leaves a lasting impression on your customers. Customer services and customer support can use it to create a channel with active users.

#### **Setting the Stage**

Kick off your chatbot flow with a warm welcome and a clear call-to-action. Use a friendly tone and provide a brief overview of what the chatbot can do for the user. For example:

#### **Offering Options**

Present the user with a set of buttons, each representing a different feedback category. This streamlines the process and allows you to tailor the subsequent questions based on the user's selection.

#### **Gathering Feedback**

Depending on the user's choice, you can now ask specific questions to gather the necessary information. For instance, if the user selects "Submit a Suggestion," you could ask for their email address and a detailed description of their suggestion.

Once you've collected the required information, provide a summary of the user's feedback and thank them for their input. You can also offer additional options, such as subscribing to a newsletter or sharing the chatbot with friends.

This will enable you to experience your chatbot as if you were a user interacting with it on WhatsApp.

During testing, pay close attention to:

- **User Experience**: Ensure the conversation flow is natural, intuitive, and free from confusing transitions.
- **Media Rendering**: Verify that images, videos, and other media assets display correctly.
- **Button Functionality**: Test each button to ensure it triggers the appropriate response or action.
- **Input Field Validation**: Check that input fields function correctly, validating user input and triggering appropriate conditional logic.

### Publishing and Sharing Your Chatbot

Once you've thoroughly tested your WhatsApp chatbot and addressed any issues, it's time to publish and share it with your audience. Typebot makes this process straightforward by providing clear instructions in the "Share" tab of your bot.

To publish your chatbot:

1. Follow the steps outlined in the "Share" tab.
2. Configure additional settings or integrations specific to your use case.

Once published, share the designated WhatsApp number or group link with your customers or audience. This allows them to interact with your chatbot seamlessly.

Remember, even after publishing, continue monitoring your chatbot's performance, gathering user feedback, and making ongoing improvements. This ensures a consistently engaging and valuable experience.

## Designing an Engaging WhatsApp Chatbot Experience

Now that you've set up the technical foundation for your WhatsApp chatbot, it's time to focus on crafting an engaging and memorable experience for your users. Here are some best practices and strategies to consider:

### Best Practices for Conversational Design

Effective conversational design is the key to creating a chatbot that feels natural and intuitive. Start by understanding your audience's needs, preferences, and communication styles. Use a friendly, conversational tone that resonates with your target users, and avoid overly formal or robotic language.

Incorporate storytelling elements and personalized touches to make your chatbot feel more human-like. For example, you could include humorous quips, relatable anecdotes, or even playful emojis to add personality and warmth to the conversation.

### Incorporating Rich Media

WhatsApp supports various rich media formats. This allows you to enhance your chatbot's visual appeal and engagement. Strategically incorporate:

- Images
- GIFs
- Videos to illustrate key points, add visual interest, or inject fun and personality.

However, keep in mind that WhatsApp has some limitations regarding media formats. For instance:

- GIF and SVG image files are not supported.
- Only .mp4 videos are compatible.

Typebot's documentation provides a list of supported media types to ensure your content displays correctly.

### Handling User Input and Providing Relevant Responses

One of the most crucial aspects of an engaging chatbot is its ability to understand and respond to user input effectively. Typebot's input fields and conditional logic features allow you to gather information from users and tailor your chatbot's responses accordingly.

You can use input fields to gather user preferences or demographic info. Then, use conditional logic to offer personalized recommendations or content based on their answers.

### Limitations of WhatsApp Chatbots

While WhatsApp chatbots offer a powerful and convenient way to engage with your audience, it's important to be aware of their limitations.

- WhatsApp only allows you to display three buttons at a time. Typebot will add "..." messages to display additional buttons.
- Certain Typebot blocks are incompatible with the WhatsApp environment, such as:
  - Payment input block
  - Chatwoot block
  - Script block
  - Google Analytics block
  - Meta Pixel blocks
  - [Cal.com](http://cal.com/) block

These blocks will be skipped if present in your chatbot's flow.

By understanding and working within these limitations, you can create a seamless and enjoyable experience for your WhatsApp chatbot users.

With these design principles and strategies in mind, you're well on your way to creating a WhatsApp chatbot that provides value and leaves a lasting impression.

## Advanced WhatsApp Chatbot Features

As you gain more experience with building and optimizing your WhatsApp chatbot, you may want to explore advanced features and capabilities. Typebot offers powerful tools and integrations to create sophisticated and personalized chatbots.

### Contact Information and System Variables

One powerful aspect of WhatsApp is automatically capturing user contact information, such as their name and phone number.

Typebot makes it easy to leverage this data within your chatbot flow using dedicated system variables.

  alt="Variables provided by WhatsApp"

/>
WhatsApp provide contact information of the user. You can assign them to variables
to personalize your chatbot's greetings and responses. This simple touch can make
the experience feel more human and tailored to the individual.

### Session Expiration and Start Bot Conditions

Typebot's WhatsApp integration allows you to configure:

- Session expiration timeouts
- Start bot conditions

This gives you greater control over the user experience and bot behavior.

The session expiration timeout determines the number of hours after which a user's session will expire if they don't interact with the bot. This feature helps manage resources and ensure inactive sessions don't consume unnecessary resources.

Start bot conditions allow you to define specific conditions that must be met before your bot is triggered when a user starts a new conversation. This is useful if you have multiple bots integrated with the same WhatsApp number, ensuring the correct bot is activated based on predefined criteria.

### Integrating with Other Services and APIs

While Typebot's WhatsApp integration provides a solid foundation, you may want to extend your chatbot's capabilities by integrating with other services and APIs. Typebot supports a wide range of integrations, including:

- Webhooks
- OpenAI
- Google Sheets
- More

For example, you could:

- Integrate your chatbot with a CRM system to automatically update customer records based on their interactions
- Use NLP/LLM APIs to help your chatbot better understand and respond to user input.

Typebot's webhook integration lets you link your chatbot to other services and APIs. This helps you create unique connections and expand your chatbot's capabilities in many different ways.

## Monitoring and Optimizing Your WhatsApp Chatbot

Congratulations! You've successfully created, tested, and deployed your WhatsApp chatbot using Typebot. However, your journey doesn't end there. To keep your chatbot running smoothly and providing value, it's important to regularly check its performance and make improvements.

### Analyzing Chatbot Usage and Performance Metrics

Typebot provides valuable analytics and metrics. These can help you gain insights into your chatbot's usage and performance. By analyzing these metrics, you can:

- Identify areas for improvement
- Understand user behavior patterns
- Make data-driven decisions to enhance effectiveness

Some key metrics to monitor include:

- **Conversation Completion Rate**: Tracks the percentage of users who complete the entire conversation flow. A low rate may indicate issues with the flow, confusing prompts, or lack of engaging content.
- **User Drop-off Points**: Identify specific points where users tend to disengage. This can help pinpoint areas that may require clarification, simplification, or additional incentives.
- **Button Click-through Rates**: Monitor button performance by tracking click-through rates. Low rates may suggest the need to optimize button labels or placements.
- **Input Field Completion Rates**: Analyze completion rates to identify potential friction points or areas where users need additional guidance.

By regularly reviewing these metrics and identifying patterns or trends, you can make informed decisions about optimizing performance and user experience.

### Updating and Improving Your Chatbot Over Time

Armed with data-driven insights and user feedback, continuously refine and improve your WhatsApp chatbot. Regularly review your chatbot's content, flow, and functionality, and make updates or adjustments as needed.

- Incorporate new features, integrations, or capabilities to enhance the user experience or provide additional value.
- Integrate your chatbot with third-party services, such as e-commerce platforms, CRM systems, or data analytics tools.

Stay up-to-date with the latest trends, best practices, and advancements in conversational AI and chatbot technology. Attend industry events, participate in online communities, and continuously educate yourself to ensure your chatbot remains relevant and cutting-edge.
