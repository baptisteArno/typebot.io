title: Typebot Privacy Policy

<br/>
<Info>
The content of this document is greatly inspired by the Plausible's [Privacy Policy](https://plausible.io/privacy). Plausible is a big source of inspiration for us in terms of transparency and privacy.
</Info>

In this policy, we lay out what data we collect and why, how your data is handled and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data.

## As a visitor to the typebot.io website
As a visitor to the typebot.io website:

- No personal information is collected
- No information such as cookies is stored in the browser
- No information is shared with advertising companies
- No information is monetized

We use PostHog EU to collect anonymous data. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic. Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more.

## As a user of Typebot, the chatbot builder

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need to provide the best service to you. We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain service offerings.

### Services we use

- A persistent first-party cookie is stored to remember you’re logged in. If you log in to your Typebot account, you give us permission to use cookies so you don’t have to log in on each returning session. This makes it easier for you to use our product. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. Cookies that are already stored may be deleted at any time.

- We use Vercel for web app hosting. The Vercel platform caches all static content at their [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) by default. This means you will get static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript served from servers that are closest to you. Server Functions (API calls) are hosted on servers in London, UK (lhr1). See Vercel [privacy policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy) for full details.

- We use Planetscale for database hosting. The database is ultimately hosted in AWS eu-west-2 (London) region. See Planetscale [privacy policy](https://planetscale.com/legal/privacy) for full details.

- We use AWS S3 in eu-west-3 (Paris) region for file storage.

- We use Cloudflare for DDoS protection and CDN services. See Cloudflare [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy) for full details.

- The payment process is handled by a third-party payment provider. If you choose to upgrade to a Typebot paid plan, the billing information and the payment process is handled by Stripe. See the Stripe [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) for full details.

- We use Sentry for anonymous error tracking only on the server's end. This allows us to meet our software quality standard. See the Sentry [privacy policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/) for full details.

- We use PostHog EU to collect anonymous behavioral data. This allows us to ultimately greatly improve the product. See the PostHog [privacy policy](https://posthog.com/privacy) for full details.

- All emails are sent using a third-party email provider. Transactional emails and email reports are sent using Brevo. See the Brevo [privacy policy](https://www.brevo.com/legal/privacypolicy) for full details.

## As a user of a typebot (the web chatbot itself)

You are bound to what the chatbot creator has set up in terms of data collection and data handling. We do not collect any personal data from chatbot users. We do not use behavioral insights to sell advertisements. We will never collect or store any personally identifiable information and we will never abuse your user’s privacy.

If the Remember user setting is on, data is stored to either local or session storage of the browser. This is to remember the user's answers if they leave the chatbot and come back later.
