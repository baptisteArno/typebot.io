<Info>
  The content of this document is greatly inspired by the Plausible's [terms of
  service](https://plausible.io/terms). Plausible is a big source of inspiration
  for us in terms of transparency and privacy.
</Info>

When we say ”company”, “we”, “our”, “us”, ”service” or ”services” in this document, we are referring to Typebot.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our [blog](/blog).

If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use this service. Violation of any of the terms below may result in the termination of your account.

That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by [being transparent](/about), and keeping an open door to your feedback.

## Account terms

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Typebot cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account (even by others who have their own logins under your account).

You may not use our service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

You must be a human. Accounts registered by bots or other automated methods are not permitted.

## Your Content

You are solely responsible for any content and other material that you submit, publish, transmit, email, or display on, through, or with the service.

We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the service. All collected answers and all the data associated to your account remains yours.

You retain ownership of your chatbots and collected data. By using our service, you grant us license to host and display your chatbots. You are responsible for ensuring your chatbots comply with privacy laws and that you have proper authorization to collect user data through your chatbots.

Typebot prohibits content and activities that:

- Engage in or promote fraudulent schemes, scams, or deceptive practices designed to obtain assets or sensitive information from others.
- Attempt to acquire sensitive information through phishing or by impersonating trustworthy entities.
- Involve sexual exploitation, abuse, or illegal sexual content of any kind.
- Infringe upon others' intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets.
- Share or distribute personal or confidential information without proper authorization.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account which violates these terms. If you find a bot that violates these terms, you can report it [here](https://docs.typebot.io/report-abuse).

## Payment Terms

Your subscription is billed monthly based on your usage. The billing amount is automatically adjusted according to the number of chats you collect through your chatbots. You can view our current pricing tiers [here](/pricing?isTiersModalOpened=true).

When you exceed your current tier's chat limit, your subscription will automatically upgrade to the next appropriate tier in the following billing cycle.

Payment is processed automatically using the payment method you provided. If a payment fails, we will attempt to collect payment again over the next few days. After multiple failed attempts, your account access may be restricted until payment is resolved.

You can [upgrade or downgrade](https://docs.typebot.io/workspace/subscription) at any time within your account settings.

## Refund Policy

We offer a 14-day refund period from your first payment. If you're not satisfied with our service during this period, we'll provide a full refund, no questions asked. To request a refund, please contact us at support@typebot.io within 14 days of your initial payment.

Refunds are only available for first-time payments to new accounts. Subsequent subscription renewals, upgrades, or additional purchases are not eligible for refunds under this policy, but you can cancel at any time to avoid future charges.

## Cancellation and Termination

You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account [here](https://docs.typebot.io/workspace/subscription#cancel-plan). We provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link.

If you cancel the service before the end of your current paid up period, your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged again. All of your typebots, and collected answers will still be accessible, your subscription will be downgraded to the free plan.

You are free to ask for your account to be deleted at any time. We will delete your account and all associated data within 30 days of your request.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms, fail to pay fees, or engage in harmful behavior. Such termination of the service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account and site stats.

Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of any service customer, company employee or officer may result in immediate account termination.

## Modifications to the service and prices

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the service with or without notice.

Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record.

Typebot shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the service.

## Content ownership, copyright and trademark

You may provide us with feedback, suggestions, and ideas about the service. You agree that we own all rights to use and incorporate the feedback you provide in any way, including in future enhancements and modifications to the service, without payment or attribution to you.

You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with Typebot. The Typebot logo and any other product or service name or slogan displayed on the service are trademarks of the company and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of the company or the applicable trademark holder. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the service, use of the service, or access to the service without the express written permission by the company.

## Privacy and security of your data

We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We collect and store data as described in our [privacy policy](./privacy-policy.mdx). You are responsible for your chatbots' privacy policies. We do not sell your data to third parties and use industry-standard security measures to protect it.

Typebot is **ISO 27001 certified**, ensuring we maintain comprehensive information security management systems, regular security audits, and continuous improvement processes to safeguard your data.

Each party agrees to handle the other party’s data in accordance with (i) all applicable laws; and (ii) privacy and security measures reasonably adequate to preserve the other party data’s confidentiality and security.

You own all right, title, and interest to your chatbots data. We do not collect and analyze personal information from chatbots' users and we do not use behavioral insights to sell advertisements. We will never collect or store any personally identifiable information and we will never abuse your user’s privacy. When using Typebot, you 100% own and control all of your workspace data. We will never sell or share your site data to any third-parties.

You agree to comply with all applicable laws including all privacy and data protection regulations.

## Liability

Your use of Typebot is at your sole risk. The service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do take uptime of our application seriously. Visit our [status page](https://status.typebot.io) to see the status of our service.

We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. We don’t guarantee completely error-free services.

We as humans can access your data to help you with support requests you make and to maintain and safeguard Typebot to ensure the security of your data and the service as a whole.

We use third party vendors to provide the necessary hardware, storage, payment processing and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all subprocessors here.

## Changes to Terms

We may modify these terms with 30 days notice. Continued use after changes indicates your acceptance of the new terms.
