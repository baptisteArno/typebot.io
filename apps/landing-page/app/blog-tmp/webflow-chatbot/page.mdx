Typebot offers flexibility in enhancing your Webflow site with conversational capabilities.
You have three distinct integration methods:

- **Standard Integration**: Embed Typebot directly into a container on your Webflow page. This approach makes the chatbot a prominent, always-visible feature. It’s perfect for dedicated landing pages or support sections where immediate engagement is crucial.

- **Bubble Integration**: Place a small chat icon in the bottom right corner of your site. This unobtrusive option lets visitors initiate conversations at their convenience without disrupting your page's design. It’s great for maintaining a clean aesthetic while providing easy access to support.

- **Popup Integration**: Trigger the chatbot based on specific user actions or time-based events. This method is powerful for lead generation or targeted messaging. Customize when and how the chatbot appears to different audience segments.

Each method serves a unique purpose and can be tailored to fit your specific goals. Your choice depends on factors like your site's design, the chatbot's primary function, and how you want to guide your visitors’ journey through your Webflow site.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Embedding Typebot in Webflow

Integrating Typebot into your Webflow site starts in your Typebot dashboard. Navigate to the 'Share' tab of your bot here. You'll find all the necessary information for embedding your chatbot across various platforms, including Webflow.

Typebot's instructions involve copying a snippet of code and pasting it into the appropriate section of your Webflow project. This code snippet brings your Typebot to life on your Webflow pages.

### Customizing Your Typebot Integration

After pasting the embed code, you're not limited to a default appearance. **Typebot offers various customization options within the Webflow interface**. You can adjust the size, position, and trigger events for your chatbot. This ensures it aligns perfectly with your site's design and user experience goals.

## Advanced Customization Options

Typebot's integration with Webflow offers advanced customization options. These features let you control how and when your chatbot interacts with visitors, boosting engagement and conversion rates.

### Triggering Typebot Commands on Button Clicks

You can trigger specific Typebot commands when a user clicks a button on your Webflow site. This feature allows seamless blending of your site's design with interactive chatbot functionality.

**To implement this:**

1. Assign a unique ID to the button you want to use as a trigger in the Settings tab of your button element in Webflow.
2. Modify the Typebot embed script to include an event listener for the button click.

Example script:

```javascript
<script type="module">
  import Typebot from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@typebot.io/js@0.3/dist/web.js'

  Typebot.initPopup({
    typebot: 'my-typebot',
  })

  document.getElementById('BUTTON_ID').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    Typebot.open()
  })
</script>
```

Replace 'BUTTON_ID' with the actual ID you assigned to your button in Webflow.

### Multiple Button Triggers

You can add multiple event listeners to trigger the chatbot from different elements on your page. Here’s how to set up two buttons:

```javascript
<script type="module">
  import Typebot from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@typebot.io/js@0.3/dist/web.js'

  Typebot.initPopup({
    typebot: 'my-typebot',
  })

  document.getElementById('BUTTON_ID_1').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    Typebot.open()
  })

  document.getElementById('BUTTON_ID_2').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    Typebot.open()
  })
</script>
```

### Customizing Chatbot Appearance

Typebot provides extensive theming options. **You can customize colors, fonts, button styles** and more directly within the Typebot interface. These changes automatically reflect in your Webflow integration.
