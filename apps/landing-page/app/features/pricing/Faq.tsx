    title: "What is considered a monthly chat?",
    content: (
      <>
        A chat is counted whenever a user starts a discussion. It is independant
        of the number of messages he sends and receives. For example if a user
        starts a discussion and sends 10 messages to the bot, it will count as 1
        chat. If the user chats again later and its session is remembered, it
        will not be counted as a new chat. <br />
        <br />
        An easy way to think about it: 1 chat equals to a row in your Results
        table
      </>
    ),

    title: "What happens once I reach the included chats limit?",
    content: (
      <>
        That's amazing, your bots are working full speed. ðŸš€
        <br />
        <br />
        You will first receive a heads up email when you reach 80% of your
        included limit. Once you have reached 100%, you will receive another
        email notification.
        <br />
        <br />
        After that, your chat limit be automatically upgraded to the next tier.

    title: "Can I cancel or change my subscription any time?",
    content: (
      <>
        Yes, you can cancel, upgrade or downgrade your subscription at any time.
        There is no minimum time commitment or lock-in.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you upgrade or downgrade your subscription, you'll get access to
        the new options right away. Your next invoice will have a prorated
        amount.

    title: "Do you offer annual payments?",
    content: (
      <>
        No, because subscriptions pricing is based on chats usage, we can only
        offer monthly plans.
