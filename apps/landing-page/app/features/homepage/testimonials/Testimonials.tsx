        We built our own onboarding template last December for all signups for
        Stillio and it works fantastic and reliably.
        <br />
        <br />
        We send the collected data to Encharge (email drip campaigns) and
        Pipedrive (CRM).
        <br />
        <br />
        We are now working on personalizing the email templates based on the
        answers (user industry and role) given in the typebot. We are big fan!

        I used Typebot at my company and was impressed with how it cut our
        customer service workload in half. I was able to create a fully
        functional chatbot in minutes. <br />
        <br /> You can create a bot to answer frequently asked questions about
        your business or create a bot that helps promote your business on social
        media or any other platform.,

        I have several chatbot builders, but Typebot is the one I use the most.
        It is simple to construct and very intuitive. <br />
        Integration with third-party applications is simple, and you can create
        the most sophisticated bots with its simplicity.

        Typebot is one of the best chatbot builders with its intelligent
        features and drag-and-drop simplicity. Its UI/UX is an earthly
        paradise...
        <br />
        What&apos;s even more important is the person who stands behind it. He
        guarantees that the platform will work and progress for a long time.

        Thanks to typebot I can finally make site forms much more modern and I
        can collect information that I would have missed before. Also ,thanks to
        Baptiste, the service is always evolving and has excellent assistance
        not only in solving but also in listening to suggestions and putting it
        into action.

        Amazing product! I&apos;m using Typebot for everything when it&apos;s
        about talking with customers.

        What&apos;s amazing with Typebot is that it makes a &quot;chat interface

        responding to customers. Highly recommend !
