# Contributing to Typebot

You are considering contributing to Typebot. I thank you for this 🙏.

Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. It can be anything from typo fixes to new features.

Let's [discuss](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/discussions/new) about what you want to implement before creating a PR if you are unsure about the requirements or the vision of Typebot.

## Get started

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

2. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

3. Follow [Local setup instructions](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io#local-setup)

Ideally, new features should have e2e tests. Check out existing tests in `/apps/builder/playwright/tests` and `/apps/viewer/playwright/tests`.

If you struggle writing new tests you can still create a WIP Pull request and I will help you 😃
