      image={{
        src: `${imagesBaseUrl}/nocodb.jpg`,
        alt: 'New NocoDB block',
      }}
    >
      The NocoDB block is a new block that allows you to store and retrieve data
      from a NocoDB database. It's a powerful tool for building applications
      that require data storage and retrieval.
      <br />
      <br />
      Finally, a great open-source alternative to existing Google Sheets block.

    <NewsletterSection title="Transcript variable">
      The "Set variable" block now has a "Transcript" value option. This injects
      the entire conversation transcript in a variable. This is useful if you
      need to provide context for an AI block. <br />
      <br />
      For example you could add in a system prompt:
      <br />
      <br />
      "Your answer should be based on the context inside the &lt;context&gt; XML
      element:
      <br />
      &lt;context&gt;{'{{'}Transcript{'}}'}&lt;/context&gt;"

    <NewsletterSection
      title="New container theme options"
      image={{
        alt: 'Chat window theme options demo',
        src: `${imagesBaseUrl}/chatContainerThemeOptions.gif`,
      }}
    >
      You can now customize the chat window theme with the new container theme
      options. This allows you to change the background color, border color, and
      text color of the chat window.
