Welcome to the Sniper WordPress Plugin GitHub repository. This is the code source and the center of active development. Here you can browse the source, look at open issues, and contribute to the project.

The project is still a mess. I'd like to make it fully automatic (with GitHub workflows). It would be great to have a repo similar to [this one](https://github.com/plausible/wordpress)
