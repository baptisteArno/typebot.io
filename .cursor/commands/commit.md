Based on current git staged changes (or all changes if no staged found) generate a gitmoji commit message following this config:

- New product feature: sparkles. Only use it for product-facing features.
- UI improvement: lipstick
- UX improvement: children_crossing
- Content / Docs: memo
- Refacto: recycle
- Bug fix: bug
- Scripts changes: wrench
- Database related changes: card_file_box

It should be product-driven as the message will be displayed on a product changelog eventually

Provide it in a text snippet I can copy.
